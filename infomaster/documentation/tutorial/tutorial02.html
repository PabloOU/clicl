Eachagent is an independent system that communicates with other agents viamessage-passing.  The agents can be centralized within a single computer system, orthey can be distributed over multiple computer systems.</P><P>Communication among agents in Infomaster is based on the idea of remoteprocedure call.  There two types of messages - requests and replies.  One agent(the requestor) sends a request to a second agent (the requestee) to ask therequestee to perform an operation.  If the request is acceptable, the requesteeperforms the requested operation and sends its answers (if any) back in a replymessage.  If the request is unsuccessful or if the responder encountersdifficulties satisfying a request, it replies with a failure message instead of ananswer.  In any case, there is one reply for each request.  (This simplecommunication model can be used to build more complicated protocols, as we willsee in future lessons.)</P><H3>2.2 Using a Web Browser to Communicate with Infomaster Agents</H3><P>It is possible for a person to send a request to any agent in an Infomastersystem (whether local or remote) by giving an appropriate URL to a web browser. The general form of a URL to communicate with an agent is shown below.<P><CENTER><TT>http://<B>&lt;hostname&gt;</B>:<B>&lt;port&gt;</B>/<B>&lt;agent&gt;</B>/<B>&lt;operation&gt;</B>?<B>&lt;arg1&gt;</B>=<B>&lt;value1&gt;</B>&...&<B>&lt;argn&gt;</B>=<B>&lt;valuen&gt;</B></TT></CENTER></P><P>Here, <TT><B>&lt;hostname&gt;</B></TT> is the name of the machine on which theagent is running, <TT><B>&lt;port&gt;</B></TT> is the associated port on which itis listening, <TT><B>&lt;agent&gt;</B></TT> is the agent's name,<TT><B>&lt;operation&gt;</B></TT> is the operation to be performed,<TT><B>&lt;argi&gt;</B></TT> is the name of an argument to<TT><B>&lt;operation&gt;</B></TT>, and <TT><B>&lt;valuei&gt;</B></TT> is thecorresponding value.<P>If non-required arguments for an operation are omitted from a URL, Infomasterwill return an HTML form that will allow the user to specify the necessaryarguments.</P><P>If the operation is also omitted, the agent assumes the user is requesting theToplevel operation, i.e.<TT>http://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;agent&gt;/</TT> is equivalent to<TT>http://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;agent&gt;/toplevel?</TT>.  Thisoperation simply returns a page of links that make it possible for the user toissue other requests.  The format of this page is under control of theadministrator.</P><P>If no agent is specified, Infomaster assumes the Standard interface, i.e.<TT>http://&lt;hostname&gt;:<port>/</TT> is equivalent to<TT>http://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/standard/</TT>.</P><P>The predefined agents in Infomaster are capable of performing a large selectionof operations appropriate to information management.  In this lesson, we areinterested in just a few of these operations.  In subsequent lessons, we will seeadditional operations.</P><P><TT>Dump</TT> takes a filename as argument.  It saves information about thecurrent state of the local Infomaster in the form of an Infomaster "dump" fileusing the given filename as its name.</P><P><TT>Load</TT> takes as argument the filename for an Infomaster "dump" file andloads that data into the system, thus recreating the state of affairs when thedump file was created.</P><P><TT>Toplevel</TT> is an operation with no arguments.  Invoking this operationcauses an agent to return a splash page in HTML with links to other operations. The content of this splash page is set by the administrator.  (We will see how todo this in Tutorial 7.)<P><TT>Seek</TT> is the operation that results in the familiar Infomaster "3-pane"interface (seen in the demonstrations in the last lesson).  The arguments to thisoperation are complicated; it is best to use it with no arguments and let thesystem provide a suitable HTML form.<P><TT>Search</TT> is like seek except that it works without frames.  It has onerequired argument - the class to be searched.<P><TT>Create</TT> is the operation to use to create a new instance of a knownclass.  The the class is a required argument.<P><TT>Inspect</TT> is the operation to use to look at the facts known about aninstance of a known class.  The object to be examined is a required argument.<H3>2.3 Predefined Agents</H3><P>When Infomaster is started fresh, it contains several predefined agents, allrunning within a single process on the host machine.  As we will see later, thesystem administrator can create additional agents and can kill existing agents. In addition, agents running on other computer systems can be linked intoInfomaster, thereby creating a distributed information system spanning theInternet.</P><P>In the current version of Infomaster, there are seven predefined local agentswhen an instance of the system is created.  The functions of these agents are summarizedin the following table.  Click on the links in the table to view metadata about theseagents.</P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER><TR><TH>Agent</TH>    <TH>Class</TH>    <TH>Description</TH></TR><TR><TD>Standard</TD>    <TD>Interface</TD>    <TD>This agent is a user-level interface to the Integrator.</TD></TR></TR><TR><TD>Integrator</TD>    <TD>Facilitator</TD>    <TD>This agent integrates data from multiple sources.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Library</TD>    <TD>Ruleserver</TD>    <TD>This agent contains rules used by the Integrator.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Warehouse</TD>    <TD>Dataserver</TD>    <TD>This agent contains data used by the Integrator.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Repository</TD>    <TD>Fullserver</TD>    <TD>This agent contains both data and rules in one place.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Manager</TD>    <TD>Fastserver</TD>    <TD>This agent contains metadata used by system.</TD></TR></TR><TR><TD>Metalibrary</TD>    <TD>Ruleserver</TD>    <TD>This agent contains metarules used by system.</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P>As mentioned above, this set can be expanded.  It can also be shrunk, i.e.agents can be killed.  (There are two exceptions to this - every running Infomastersystem must contain a standard interface and a manager.)</P><H3>2.4 Manager and Metalibrary</H3><P>"Baselevel" information is information about the application area of aninformation system.  "Metalevel" information, by contrast, is information aboutthat information or about the Infomaster system itself.  It is noteworthy that allstate information in Infomaster takes the form of baselevel or metalevelinformation.  There are no hidden variables or data structures.  Consequently, allstate is fully visible and fully changeable.<P>The Manager and Metalibrary contain metalevel information used by Infomaster.  The Manager contains metalevel data, and the Metalibrary contains metalevel"rules".  In this section, we take a brief look at metalevel data.<P>The Manager allows metalevel information to be accessed and updated in the sameway that baselevel information is accessed and updated.  There are classes ofobjects; each class has attributes; and each attribute has values drawn from anappropriate class.  Every metalevel object is an instance of one of thesemeta-classes and has appropriate values for the associated metalevel attributes.<P>To see this, go to the Manager interface in an infomaster system and explore. Look back at the demonstration from Lesson 1 and try to do an anlaogous search ofthe Manager.  Of course, the classes and attributes in the Manager are different,but the style of the interface is the same.<H3>2.5 Creating and Deleting Agents</H3><P>Agents are created or destroyed in Infomaster using the Manager.<P>To create an agent, invoke the Seek operation, open the classes in the leftpanel until the various types of agents are exposed, and click on the snowflakenext to the class of agent you wish to create.<P>To destroy an agent, use the Seek operation to find the agent, click on its linkto bring up an inspect page, click the Edit button at the bottom of the page, andpress the Delet button at the bottom of that page.<H3>Exercises</H3><OL><P><LI>Start a fresh Infomaster.  Invoke the <TT>Load</TT> operation by typingthe URL <TT>http://<hostname>:<port>/load?</TT> into the address/location line ofyour Browser.  On the resulting page, enter the filename for the Housewaressystem.  This is <TT>examples/housewares/load.franz</TT> in Unix,Linux , and Windows; and it is <TT><Infomasterdirectory>:examples:housewares:load.mcl</TT> in MacOS.  Press the Submit button. Infomaster should respond <TT>Done</TT>.  If it says <TT>Nil</TT>, this indicatesfailure, e.g. the file was not found.  (Check that you got the filename right.)<P><LI>Confirm that Infomaster has loaded the file by accessing the Standardagent for the Infomaster running on your machine.  You should see the splashpage for the Catalog.  (You may need to press the Refresh button in yourbrowser.)<P><LI>Find all 15" skillets with Teflon-coated interiors made by companiesincorporated in North America.<P><LI>Switch to the Regal interface and find the single 15" skillet made byRegal and change some of the properties of this skillet.<P><LI>Invoke the <TT>Dump</TT> operation by typing the URL<TT>http://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/dump?</TT> into your Browser.  Enter afilename of your choice and press the Submit button.<P><LI>Kill your Infomaster, restart, invoke the <TT>Load</TT> operation, andenter the name of your dump file.  Confirm that the system has been revived andthat the changes you made have been preserved.<P><LI>Experiment with URLs.  Look at the splash pages of the other agents inthe system.  Explore.<P><LI>Go to the manager agent.  Use the seek operation to find all agents.  Lookat the properties of the agents.<P><LI>Create a new fastserver.  Fill in a header and a footer of your ownchoosing.  Point your URL at the newly created agent and check that the headerand footer appear as you suggested.</OL><BR/><HR/><CENTER><FONT SIZE=1>(c) Copyright 1997-2003 by<A HREF="mailto:genesereth@stanford.edu">Michael Genesereth</A>.
