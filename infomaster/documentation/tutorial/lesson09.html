(If your IP address is www.xxx.yyy.zzz, allsites in your network share www but may differ elsewhere.)<P><LI>Create a ruleserver.  Add data for a singleuser with a password of your choosing.  Add information allowing access from just oneIP address.  (alteernatively, do the same for all sites in your domain.  (If your IPaddress is www.xxx.yyy.zzz, all sites in your network share www but may differ elsewhere.) Add this ruleserver as infobase for the standard interface to your Housewares system.  Nowtry to use the system.  Confirm that you can use it, after typing in the user name andpassword you specified in the ruleserver.  Now, try from a different browser with adifferent user name and/or password.<P><LI>Set up a security interface and ruleserver.  It should include atleast one class, called <TT>user</TT>, with slots handle and pwd at the veryleast.  Arrange so that anyone can add a new user but no one can see the listof users or anything about them.  Use the interface to create a new user witha new password.<P><LI>Specify a viewrelation and an updaterelation for some attribute in your Housewaressystem.  Define these relations so that only you can see this information.  Now ask somequestions (as yourself) and notice that you get to see the information.  Quit yourbrowser and restart.  This time, when challenged, offer the name and pasword for anotheruser.  Notice that the attribute is no longer visible to you.</OL><H3>Exercises</H3><OL><P><LI>Start a new Infomaster and load a fresh copy of the Housewares system.<P><LI>Examine the unspsc.521518.type relation in the database named Repository.<P><LI>Use Ask to create a virtual table with just one column listing all products of typeskillet.  Create a virtual table with 2 columns, the first listing a product and thesecond listing country of the manufacturer of the product.<P><LI>Examine the unspsc.521518.material relation.  Change the material of6019919-1qt-Sauce-Pan to iron.  (It is the next to last product listed in the relation.) Delete the material of 6019920-1.5qt-Sauce-Pan. (it is the last product listed in therelation.)  Add a row specifying a material for 6019920-1.5qt-Sauce-Pan, e.g. aluminum.<P><LI>Use the Transform operation to change the material of every iron productto Aluminum.</OL><BR/><HR/><CENTER><ADDRESS>(c) Copyright 1997-2002 by<A HREF="mailto:genesereth@stanford.edu">Michael Genesereth</A>.
