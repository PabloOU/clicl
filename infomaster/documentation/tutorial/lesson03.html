In future versions of the system, Infomaster will generate XML and XFormpages instead and will rely on style sheets to convert these pages into suitable HTMLform.  This will give the user greater control of formatting.  However, (almost all ofthe) capabilities discussed in this tutorial will remain the same, as they areindependent of this mechanism.<H3>3.2 Operations</H3><P>Clicking on the link for an object on any page invokes the <TT>Inspect</TT> operation. The first step in executing <TT>Inspect</TT> is to determine the preferred class of theobject.  See the section on Interfaces to see how this is done.  Once the preferred classis found, Infomaster computes values for the attributes belonging to the preferred classand presents these on a page for the specified object.<P>The <TT>Create</TT> operation allows the user to create a new instance of a specificclass together with values for the attributes associated with that class.  This operationis automatically invoked when the user clicks the red snowflake next to a class name.<P>The <TT>Change</TT> operation allows the user to change the values of the attributesfor an instance of a specific class.  This operation is automatically invoked when theuser presses the Change button on the bottom of Inspect pages.<P>Searching a semantic net can be accomplished in either single pane or multi-panemode.  Multi-pane mode uses frames; single-pane mode does not.  The<TT>frontdoor</TT> and <TT>search</TT> operations support single pane search.  The<TT>search</TT> operation allows the user to find instances of classes by specifyingvalues for its attributes.  <TTfrontdoor</TT> allows the user to navigate a hierarchyof classes.  Clicking on a class in the displayed hierarchy invokes the <TT>search</TT>operation.  Clicking on the triangles next to a class opens and/or closes theclass, i.e. displays its subclasses or eliminates the subclasses from the display. Clicking on the red snowflake beside a class (if present) invokes the <TT>create</TT>operation.  The <TT>>Seek</TT> operation combines all of these capabilities on a singlemulti-pane page.<P>If you have a page that mentions a class, then clicking on the link for that classresults in a page that shows the corresponding class table.  This invokes the<TT>Displayclass</TT> operation with the class as argument.  You can also invoke thisoperation by typing the <TT>Displayclass</TT> request directly into your browser'sAddress window.<H3>3.3 Properties of Classes</H3><P>Attributes associated with a class and their effects on user interface:<P><TT>Superclass</TT>.  The only user interface effect concerns the apprearance ofthe class hierarchy in the left pane of a Seek window.  If there are classes that list agiven class as superclass, then the given class is displayed with a red triangle, whichcan be opened to reveal those subclasses.  Otherwise, it is paired with a grey triangle,which cannot be opened.<P><TT>Predicate</TT>.  This determines the predicate used to determine membership ina class.  As an example, consider the class <TT>country</TT> with predicate<TT>country.instance</TT>.  If one uses a create page to create a new instance, say usa,Infomaster will record the class of that instance with a sentence of the form<TT>(country.instance usa)</TT>.  Analogously, if one uses a search page to findinstances of <TT>country</TT>, Infomaster will look for sentences of the form<TT>(country.instance &le;country&ge;)</TT>.  If no predicate is specified, Infomasteruses the classifier for the agent executing the operation.  See the section on interfacesfor how this works.<P><TT>Attribute</TT>.  This determines which attribute relations are displayed oninspect, search, create, change, and compare pages.  (Note that this decision is alsoaffected by properties of the attribute relations as well.  See next section.)<P><TT>Sorter</TT>.  This determines which attribute is used to sort the values onresult pages.<H3>3.4 Properties of Attribute Relations</H3><P>User interface attributes associated with an attributerelation:<P><TT>Domain</TT>.  No effects on user interface<P><TT>Range</TT>.  Determines what sort of subframe is produced when the + button isclicked.  Also determines the entries on menus hen no options are specified.<P><TT>Unique</TT>.  If an attributerelation has a unique value, the snowflake next to itis suppressed, since it is impossible for there to be more than one value.<P><TT>Total</TT>.  No effects on user interface.<P><TT>Createstyle</TT> determines which modality is used on Create pages.<P><TT>Changestyle</TT> determines which modality is used on Change pages.<P><TT>Searchstyle</TT> determines which modality is used on Search pages.<P><TT>Comparestyle</TT> determines which modality is used on Compare pages.<P><TT>Inspectstyle</TT> determines which modality is used on Inspect pages.<P><TT>Hierarchyrelation</TT> specifies the binary relation to use in computingexpansions of values for attribute relations with style ProgressiveHierarchicalChoiceList.<P><TT>Option</TT> specifies values to use in populating dropdownlists andmultichoicelists.  If absent, range information is used.<P><TT>Createdefault</TT> determines an initial value on create pages.<P><TT>Searchdefault</TT> determines an initial value on Search pages.<P><TT>Createlabel</TT> determines an optional string to print out next to the attributerelation on <TT>Create</TT> pages. This is commonly used to specify units, specialwarnings, an so forth.<P><TT>Searchlabel</TT> determines an optional string to print out next to the attributerelation on <TT>Search</TT> pages. This is commonly used to specify units, specialwarnings, an so forth<P>Modalities:<P>A <TT>glyph</TT> is a simple print-out of the name of an object.<P>A <TT>dropdownlist</TT> is a menu in which only one value can be specified at a time. (This will soon be renamed <TT>selector</TT> as in the original Infomaster.)<P>A <TT>multichoicelist</TT> is a menu of choices allowing selection of multipleentries.  If more than one choice is selected, the choices are assumed to bedisjunctive.    (This will soon be renamed <TT>menu</TT> as in the original Infomaster.)<P>A <TT>radiobutton</TT> allows the user to specify a value by pushing mutuallyexclusive "radio buttons".<P>A <TT>checkbox</TT> allows the user to select multiple values using check boxes.<P>A <TT>ProgressiveHierarchicalChoiceList</TT> allows the user to specify a value byexpanding a hierarchy of choices.  The <TT>Option</TT> information for an attribute withthis modality specifies the values for the initial selector.  The<TT>hierarchyrelation</TT> determines how these values are expanded. (This will soon be renamed <TT>hierarchy</TT> as in the original Infomaster.)<P>An <TT>interval</TT> permits the user to supply upper and lower bounds on a value.  <P>A <TT>typein</TT> cell allows the user to enter a value by typing its name.  <P>A <TT>stringfield</TT> allows the user to enter a string by typing its namewithout the enclosing double quotes.<P>A <TT>textarea</TT> allows the user to enter a string by typing its namewithout the enclosing double quotes.  It is similar to a <TT>stringfield</TT> except thatit provides more area.<P>A <TT>password</TT> cell allows the user to enter a password but does not echo theactual characters.<P><TT>URLstyle</TT> allows user to insert a url, which is then rendered in other placesas a link.  <P><TT>Emailstyle</TT> allows user to insert an email address, which is then rendered inother places as a mail link. <P><TT>Noshow</TT> means that the attribute is suppressed.  Particularly useful inkeeping <TT>Compare</TT> tables small while allowing full information to appear on<TT>Inspect</TT> pages.<H3>3.5 Properties of Interfaces</H3>Every Infomaster agent has an HTML interface with which it can communicate with its humanusers.  The administrator of a system determines how much functionality can be exposed bysetting the parameters of the agent's interface.  Here are some of the attributes.<P><TT>Metadata</TT> determines which agent contains the metadata for the interface. This is usually the Manager; and, if no value is specified, the Manager is assumed. Don't fiddle with this unless you know what you are doing.<P><TT>Classifier</TT> gives a binary relation that specifies the preferred class forobjects when object links are clicked using that interface.  If no classifier isspecified, Infomaster assumes <TT>isa</TT>.  The classifier is also used to express thetype of objects in classes for which there is no predicate relation.<P><TT>Rootclass</TT> determines the top-level classes displayed on <TT>Frontdoor</TT> and<TT>Seek</TT> pages.<P><TT>Nocreate</TT> specifies classes that the user is prevented from creating.  When aclass is listed as nocreate, the snowflakes disappear from the left pane of the Seekinterface.<P><TT>Nochange</TT> specifies classes that the user is prevented from changing membersof the specified class.  When a class is listed as nochange, the Edit button disappearsfrom instances of that class.<P><TT>Nocommand</TT> specifies buttons that are NOT to be offered to the user.  Optionsinclude Add, Apropos, Convert, Create, Creator, Display, Update, Updater, Inspect,Inspector, Memory, Metalevel, Rulify, Save, Sort, Subframem and others.   The<TT>Convert</TT> option determines whether various format conversion buttons appear atthe bottoms of various pages.  The Subframe button determines whether the + buttonappears, allowing the user to expand attribute cells into subframe searches.  Themetalevel button determines whether the pencil icons appear next to concepts, allowingtheir properties to be examined in the Manager.  And so forth. <P><TT>Header</TT> specifies the HTML text to be displayed at the top of every page.<P><TT>Footer</TT> specifies the HTML text to be displayed at the bottom of every page.<P><TT>Frontpage</TT> specifies the HTML text to be displayed by the Toplevel operation(or when no operation is specified).  If specified, this text is used in place of headerand footer on the front page.<P><TT>Security</TT> specifies an agent containing security data.  If no security agent isspecified, no security checking is done, i.e. anybody can access the system.  Thissubject lies beyond the scope of this tutorial.<H3>Exercises</H3><OL><P><LI>Start a new Infomaster and load a fresh copy of the Housewares system.<P><LI>Examine the unspsc.521518.type relation in the database named Repository.<P><LI>Use Ask to create a virtual table with just one column listing all products of typeskillet.
