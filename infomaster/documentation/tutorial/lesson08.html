The user can search for relevant documents using a subjecthierarchy (as in Yahoo) or by specifying one or more keywords to find in the body of thedocument (as in Google).  In either case, the result is a potentially large list ofsometimes relevant but sometimes irrelevant documents.  The user must then peruse thesedocuments himself in the hope of finding the desired information.</P><P>Furthermore, the interaction is almost invariably "pull" rather than "push".  There islittle support for notification of changes.  The next day, the user must do his searchagain, to see whether anything has changed.</P><P>Finally, in such systems, there is no support for update.  It is not possible for anauthorized user to specify information and have it distributed to appropriate sources.</P><P>One important advantage of structured information is that it enables a solution to theseshortcomings.</P><P>In Infomaster, the user can ask sophisticated questions and get answers instead of longand often incomplete lists of sometimes irrelevant documents.  Information from multiplesources is automatically aggregated into a single document.</P><P>He can post a request to be notified if additional relevant information becomes availableand be sure of receiving only relevant notifications and receiving them only once.</P><P>Infomaster also provides support for updates.  In addition to local updates to individualinformation sources, it supports global updates -- it accepts new information from usersand, provided the users are suitably authorized, ensures that that information isautomatically disseminated to the appropriate information sources for automatic or manualupdate.  Along the way, it is capable of sending notifications to users who have expressedinterest in such changes.</P><H3>8.2 Aggregation</H3><P>Example of defining a "stub" for a remote agent, named yourserver.  In this case, theagent is assumed to communicate in ACL.  It runs on host kiosk.stanford.edu and listens forconnections on port 3000.  It stores table p.<XMP>(isa yourserver aclserver)(host yourserver "kiosk.stanford.edu")(port yourserver 3000)(specialty yourserver p)</XMP><P>Once this stub is created, it is possible for a user to access this agent through thelocal user interface.  For example, one could ask to see all facts about p using the examinecommand sent to the local infomaster, as shown below.<CENTER><TT>http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/yourserver/examine?concept=p</TT></CENTER><P>One can create stubs for other types of agents in the same way.  The examplebelows described another server, called theirserver.  In this case, the agent is assumed tocommunicate in Soap.  It also runs on host kiosk.stanford.edu and listens for connections onport 3000.  It stores table q.<XMP>(isa yourserver soapserver)(host yourserver "kiosk.stanford.edu")(port yourserver 3000)(specialty yourserver q)</XMP><P>Importantly, a local facilitator or transformer can integrate information availablefrom both yourserver and theirserver.<P>As an example, suppose one had the following rule defined in the Library.<XMP>(<= (r ?x ?z) (p ?x ?y) (q ?y ?z))</XMP><P>Asking the local Integrator to show all tuples of the r relation would result in thesystem retrieving p from yourserver and then getting the appropriate q tuples fromtheirserver.<BR><HR><CENTER><ADDRESS>(c) Copyright 1997-2002 by<A HREF="mailto:genesereth@stanford.edu">Michael Genesereth</A>.
