; map coloring: assign each REGION a HUE so that no two ADJacent regions
;   are colored the same.  ESODB predicate is just COLOR.

; types for COLOR
(=> (= (color ?x) ?y) (and (region ?x) (hue ?y)))

; if two regions are assigned the same color, they cannot be adjacent
(=> (= (color ?x) (color ?z)) (not (adj ?x ?z))) 

; every region needs a color
; (forall ?x (=> (region ?x) (exists ?y (color ?x ?y)))) 
;(<= (hascolor ?x) (color ?x ?y))
;(=> (region ?x) (hascolor ?x))
