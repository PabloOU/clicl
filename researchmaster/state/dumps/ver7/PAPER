Both are datalog-based (without negation but with recursion).  The result is a language for specifying and executing network algorithms on untrusted networks.  Interestingly, the implementation approach is bottom-up, which seems to be a push-driven choice.  The result is that the current state of the network is updated based on triggers, where information is sent to the nodes that might use it.  (Admittedly, this is conjecture as the implementation details are left out.)  In contrast, top-down approaches appear to implement a pull technology and requires asking various information sources at the appropriate times.")

    (paper.description alferes94 "
Alferes shows that Situation Calculus extended with concurrent actions (e.g. buytoothpaste||buyshampoo) is no more expressive than standard Situation Calculus.  Intuitively, give names to every subset of actions since there are only 2^n such subsets of n actions.  Use those names as the actions in situation calculus.  The trouble here is how do we produce the effect axioms of a concurrent action set given the effect axioms of the individual actions?  Some of these axioms simply must be given by the user, e.g. buying toothpaste and shampoo at the same time might result in a free bar of soap, though neither effect axiom for buying toothpaste or shampoo would mention soap.  For those actions whose composition (in Alferes terms) can be determined automatically, the authors offer a solution using nonmonotonic logic: if Holds(p, Result(a, Result(b,s))) and Holds(p, Result(b, Result(a,s))) and there is no definition for Holds(p, Result(a||b),s), then conclude Holds(p, Result(a||b,s)).  Alferes elaborates the rule to include preconditions and subsets of size other than 2 (though some technical details arise in doing the latter).

situation calculus.  Third he shows how to parallelize automated
theorem proving where a theory has been partitioned into pieces.  Fourth
he gives algorithms for automatically decomposing theories, based on
the syntactic character of the axioms.  Last he describes a logic-based
subsumption architecture for automated robot control, similar in spirit
to Golog.  An appendix on logic, one on reactive control systems, and
30 pages of references round out the thesis.  It should be noted
that while he does augment various resolution procedures to work
in this parallel setting, the rest of the results are independent of
a particular calculus.

Arenas and Bertossi build on J.

They also use Reiter's work on evaluating a query in the state that results after executing a sequence of actions.  The authors meld these two approaches to answer queries about the evolution of a database that contain quantification over states (for two specific types of queries).  This work also leads to a process for transforming dynamic integrity constraints into static ones and transforming history dependent action preconditions into local preconditions.

The hierarchy of data makes these questions important, and the hierarchy of data is important because it is the only realistic way for people to express privacy policies.  Additionally, the authors show how DAMP can be used to help P3P, XPref, APPEL, and DPAL interoperate, both theoretically and practically.  In summary: show how to query an abstract policy when the data is hierarchical.")

The basic model is a state machine, where sentences in temporal logic describe a set of acceptable traces through that state machine.  Give complexity for various important operations, e.g. given a finite trace, can we find an action to execute that is faithful to the policy (so that we can act faithfully in the future as well).  Cite SPIN as an algorithm for answering such questions well in practice in spite of PSPACE results.  In summary: a language for compactly and naturally expressing privacy policies.")

Baumgartner and Furbach introduce Restart Model Elimination and a couple of refinements.
RME obviates the need for contrapositives; all the rules are written in the form
A1 | ... | An <= B1 ^ ... ^ Bm, i.e. the only extension steps that can be performed
are on one of the Ai.  The price we pay is that whenever the literal on the top of the 
stack is positive, we put the goal literal onto the top of the stack (forcibly in
strict RME), hence the name Restart ME.  Also, this means that ancestry pruning cannot
be used with RME if completeness is to be preserved.  Soundness and refutational 
completeness results.  Some experimental results and fairly lengthy comparison
to other calculi.

The language for expressing authorization decisions is  unstratified logic programming with both NAF and true negation.  The resulting formalism requires stable models/well-founded semantics, which the authors alter to address authorization and some amount of conflict resolution.  The resulting semantics sometimes satisfies more than one authorization decision because of multiple models; consequently, two forms of reasoning can be employed: brave and cautious.   ")

This is typically done for two reasons: to reduce burden on the server and to avoid latencies in communicating with the server.  However, when a server fails to replicate the validation performed on the client, it is potentially vulnerable to attack.  In this paper, we present a novel approach for automatically detecting potential server-side vulnerabilities of this kind in existing (legacy) web applications through blackbox analysis. We discuss the design and implementation of NoTamper, a tool that realizes this approach. NoTamper has been employed to discover several previously unknown vulnerabilities in a number of open-source web applications and live web sites. ")

Parameter tampering attacks are dangerous to a web application

the client can capitalize on the missing server validation. In this paper, we describe WAPTEC, a tool that is designed to automatically identify parameter tampering vulnerabilities and generate exploits by construction to demonstrate those vulnerabilities. WAPTEC
involves a new approach to whitebox analysis of the server's code.
We tested WAPTEC on six open source applications and found

all countable models of the first-order theory of that model are isomorphic.
In this work, he produces an algorithm for constructing a tree that
satisfies a given set of constraints, where those constraints require
the existence of nodes that meet certain conditions.  Three possible conditions:
x is an ancestor of y, x and y are equal, and x occurs in a subtree to
the left of the subtree that includes y.  While these constraints force
nodes to exist that satisfy particular relationships, OOCSPs force 
particular nodes to have a particular relationship.

Borrett and Tsang construct a framework for searching through various constraint satisfaction problem formulations and selecting one.  They only consider
formulations of the form <V,D,C>, i.e. typical CSP formulations.  They break the problem into 4 parts: generating an initial formulation, constructing operators to change that formulation, constructing heuristics for choosing which operator to apply, and constructing an evaluation function to that determines the cost of a given formulation.  They go on to demonstrate a particular type of operator: the introduction of redundant constraints and show how searching through CSP formulations with this type of operator works in their framework.

Bundy describes SUMS (System which Understands Mathematical

The SUMS proof process represents the natural numbers in

truth of a conjecture.  Bundy makes an interesting point at the 
end of the paper: mathematicians do not usually manipulate
logic to prove theorems.  Rather, they convince themselves
of the correctness of a conjecture through diagrams or other
semantic insights and then use logic as a language for
communicating to others the proof of the theorem.  SUMS
is an attempt at building a machine that simply 
convinces itself of the truth of a conjecture.

PLANSAT[2 ,2] (PLANSAT where all operators have at least 2 positive preconditions and 2 postconditions) is also PSPACE-complete.  Results are shown for a variety of restrictions, concluding that without severe restrictions, PLANSAT is NP-complete or PSPACE-complete.
These results carry over to PLANMIN (the decision problem of determining whether an instance has a solution of k or fewer operators.  The new results here show a variety of PLANMIN are NP-complete, and a couple, very restricted versions are polynomial.  He also shows results for Propositional Strips with formulas (Extended Propositional STRIPS).  EPLANSAT, EPLANSAT[0,1 ] restricted to define Horn clauses are PSPACE-complete.

    (paper.description cadoli2000b "
The authors leverage previous work on compilation complexity classes to compare
various propositional knowledge formalisms.  They introduce two axes for comparing
such formalisms under translation: theorem-preservation and model-preservation.
That is, given a set of sentences in one formalism, translate those sentences
into another formalism so that (1) the theorems are preserved across the translation
after a translation of their own or (2) the models are preserved across the
translation after a translation of their own.  The translation of premise sets
is assumed to be polynomial in size; the requirement on the translation of
theorems/models is that the representation of the translation process itself
must be polynomial in size.  

The authors then introduce the notion of 
model-C and thm-C classes.  A formalism belongs to the model-C class iff 
model checking in that formalism is in the compilability class C, where the KB is 
the fixed part and the model is the varying part.  A formalism belongs to
the thm-C class iff inference in that formalism is in the compilability class C,
where the KB is the fixed part and the query is the varying part.

Next the authors prove that two formalisms in the same model-C/thm-C class then
there must be a poly-size reduction between the two formalisms that 
preserves models/theorems.  They also show that if two problems are in different
classes there is no polynomial size reduction satisfying models/theorems.

Finally, the propositional formalisms stable model semantics, circumscription, 
generalized closed world, skeptical default logic, credulous default logic, 
WIDTIO belief revision, and skeptical belief revision are analyzed in this 
framework, giving fairly complete coverage of inference/model space complexity.

Cadoli and Donini review techniques for propositional knowledge base compilation.  
The goal
is to rewrite a KB in a form that will answer queries more quickly.  They survey
exact compilation: prime implicates and implicants, unit-resolution-complete 
methods, and theory prime implicates.  They look at approximate compilation:
anytime versions of exact methods, horn approximations (can result in unsound
inference).  They consider compiling non-monotonic knowledge bases with
circumscription, default logic, and belief revision.  All those techniques aim
to reduce intractable query answering to tractable query answering.  Lastly,
Cadoli and Donini mention compilations of _polynomial-time_ query answering,
compilations into something other than a KB, and compare compilation to 
fixed-parameter tractability.

Prawitz's procedure and V-resolution.  A chapter on program analysis
leads to query answering and program synthesis in the final chapter.

However (1) I get the impression that they haven't gone further than writing the paper and (2) they are concerned with performing actions on the network in response to human events rather than network events. They are trying to replace today's plethora of configuration tools with a single, global configuration tool.  We are also creating a global configuration tool but at a higher level of abstraction than today's networks provide (routing based on user/host/ap).  That higher-level of abstraction makes our global configuration tool (FML) harder to construct because it must operate at line speed, not human speed.

Chomicki describes an algorithm for maintaining temporal constraints on a database, which are written in past first order temporal logic.  Instead of storing the entire history of the database, Chomicki describes a way to roll up the history (in a lossy way) into auxiliary relations in the database.  She assumes the set of constraints is fixed, which means a single auxiliary relation can be stored for each sentence in the constraints.  She proves this encoding to be polynomially-bounded in the number of domain values that appear in the database over time.  Chomicki extends this work to include real-time constraints, which refer to a clock.

The authors consider the problem of computing modes, i.e. binding

uses binary clause semantics and convex hull abstraction

very similar work was done in 2001 by Vanhoof and Bruynooghe

Uses a finite state machine as a model: the state of a computer system is comprised of the rights given to each principals for each object in the system.  An action is either (1) the invocation of a right, (2) the deinvocation of a right, (3) the granting of a new right, or (4) the revocation of a right.  Each transition results in a new state and one of two outputs: (1) accept or (2) reject.  This model is a good one, in my opinion.  The logic chosen for describing this model is S5, a modal logic that is semantically captured (so they say) by Kripke structures where the accessibility relation represents equivalence classes.  Additionally, there are certain ontological commitments made for the vocabulary of the logic.  Finally, this logic is translated into prolog for processing.  Experiments are performed on a Unix and a Winnt system.  While I very much like the structure of the paper, I get the sense that there are some subtle (and at least one not-so-subtle) errors mathematically.  Too much math relative to the intuition makes following difficult.")

a technique for achieving the benefits of complete information
from starting from incomplete information by first instantiating
to complete the theory, then reasoning quickly, and finally 
ignoring those results which were artificially  introduced by
the process of instantiation.  This is a position piece trying to

Dershowitz first defines the notion of a non-terminating rewrite system,
i.e. one with an infinite homeomorphic self-embedding derivation.  Then
he defines a simplification ordering as a partial ordering with
the replacement (monotonicity), subterm, and deletion properties.  If there
is a simplification ordering for a term rewriting system such that l &gt; r for
every rewrite rule l -&gt; r then the rewrite system terminates.  Dershowitz
goes on to define a quasi-simplification ordering, which is weaker than
a simplification ordering, making it easier to prove rewrite systems
terminate.  The reason this paper is located in this section is that
the notion of a recursive path ordering is then defined.  RPO and
variants thereof are used in modern theorem provers when ordering
is necessary.  The last section goes through a series of examples
that demonstrate how to prove rewrite systems terminate.

The authors examine complexity issues that arise when intersecting several

the unique minimal model (which is a characteristic model) can be done
in linear time in the number of KBs.  Finding all-models can be solved
with polynomial delay (a polynomial amount of time between outputting
models).  In a sense, that means the procedure is polynomial, but the 
number of outputs could be exponential.  Finding all characteristic
models of the intersection has no polynomial time algorithm (even if
P = NP).  Answering deductive queries can still be accomplished in
polynomial time by looking at each KB independently.  Finally, abduction
is shown to be intractable, which differs from the result of a single
KB (where it is polynomial).

Etherington, et.al. give a preliminary description of representing a KB with a set of atoms.

A set of atoms is not very expressive, so the first extension is to allow definite clauses: a(x)=>b(x).  To deal with this they use a closed world assumption.

shows the following are all equivalent for a given set of sentences
S.  1) There is an operator O that maps nonempty families of models
into models such that if sigma is a sentence in S and R_i is a
nonempty family of models, then sigma holds for O(R_i) iff sigma
holds for each R_i.  2) Whenever Sigma is a consistent subset of S
and Sigma* is the set of sentences in S that are logical consequences
of Sigma, there is an Armstrong model--it obeys Sigma* and no other
sentences in S.  3) Whenever Sigma is a subset of S and phi_i is a 
nonempty subset of S then Sigma |= V phi_i iff there is some i for
which Sigma |= phi_i.  For FOL in general, there is no Armstrong relation for 
first-order axiom sets.  Take the empty set of axioms, and assume
there is an Armstrong relation R.  R will either entail or not
entail any non-tautology sigma, which means R is not an Armstrong
relation for the axiom set.  A corollary to this theorem shows
that any axiom set Delta in a Horn-related subset of FOL can be
represented with a single, infinite model.

This framework lessens the overhead of authorization management because as users change positions within the company, they need only be assigned different roles, instead of all the permissions that are necessary for performing those roles.  Several good examples in this well-written paper.  What is interesting here is that to perform a given operation, being assigned a role with permission to execute that operation is necessary but not sufficient.  There are also conditions that must hold at the time that operation is to be executed; this gives us both static and dynamic permissions checks to perform.  Moreover, the objects being given permission to execute various operations on are both atomic, e.g. read/write on a file, and entire systems, e.g. one user cannot initiate a purchase order, authorize it, record its arrival, and authorize payment.  These four steps can only occur if at least two people were involved. ")

This short paper puts the STRIPS work in a historical context, examining both the plan generator and execution monitor.  Green's work on deductive plan synthesis was the first real planner, but most researchers didn't explore monitoring execution (they were assuming computational environments).  Fikes and Nilsson used 'kernels' to represent the sentences that must be true at each stage of the plan for the rest of the plan to succeed.  They also used the notion of a 'triangle table' to represent plans so that serendipitous acts and action-failure-but-that's-all-you-can-do-so-just-try-again events would not require replanning.

Geddis investigates Nonhorn caching for model elimination.  Astrachan and
Stickel did the seminal work on caching for the Horn case.  Nonhorn
caching is made difficult by the reduction operation, i.e. proofs of
subgoals are context dependent.  Previous work stored the context and
the proven subgoal.  Geddis shows that if a literal has a completion in
one context, it has a completion in every context.  Thus, if a subgoal
cannot be completed, it can be added to a failure cache.  A completion is
not the same as a proof, however, and there are no results for success
caching.  If a depth-limited search-strategy is used, incompleteness can
result; Geddis found no solution for this problem.  Also discussed is an
extension to David Smith's work: postponement caching.  It basically avoids
infinite recursions if possible by 'enslaving' a subgoal to an ancestor
if the two unify.  It is complete for Horn and incomplete for nonHorn.

in which case multiple diagrams need to be generated to achieve
completeness.  The system is also unique in the fact that it does
not give the theorem prover a complete axiomitization of geometry,

ConGolog extends Golog (both implementations being in Prolog) to include concurrent actions (conceptualized as interleaving actions of different processes that can block, in the OS sense).  The constructs introduced here include synchronized conditionals (test-and-set), synchronized loops, concurrent execution, concurrency with different priorities (the lower priority process can only execute if the higher priority one is blocked or finished), concurrent iteration, and interrupts.  Nondeterminstic iteration can be useful when an unspecified number of programs need to be run concurrently, e.g. an FTP server.  Some more work is required to handle procedures.  The semantics given in the original Golog paper were evaluation semantics.  Here the authors switch to transition semantics and require all the macros of Golog to become embedded in the language.
Exogenous events are handled by allowing the user to specify which primitive actions may occurs outside the control of the program.  A predefined program for choosing a possible exogenous action, checking its preconditions, and executing it if possible is run concurrently with the user-defined program. To handle truly overlapping actions such as filling-bath-tub and singing-do-re-mi, the authors suggest thinking of filling-bath-tub as not an action, but rather as a state, which requires the start-filling action to enter the state and the stop-filling action to exit the state.  This way, interleaving filling-bath-tub and singing-do-re-mi can happen at the same time.

Giunchiglia and Walsh describe a theory of abstraction in very general terms,
which is intended to be independent of proof system.  Most generally,
an abstraction is a mapping between a pair of formal systems, where a
formal system consists of a language and a subset of that language defining
the axioms.  Axiomatic formal systems include an extra element: the
proof system.  Abstractions are categorized by whether they increase, decrease, or
leave constant the set of consequences of the theory: TI, TD, TC.  The authors
claim the TI abstractions is the true meaning of abstraction.  TD abstractions
can be used to prove entailment, i.e. if TD(Delta) |= phi then Delta |= phi.
TI abstractions can be used to prove negative entailment, i.e. if
TI(Delta) |/= phi then Delta |/= phi.  Refutation systems are concerned
not with provability but with inconsistency.  Abstractions in this setting
are characterized as NTI, NTD, and NTC.  If the formal system includes
negation and the abstraction f is negation preserving, i.e. f(-phi) = -f(phi)
then NT* and T* are equivalent.  Further classifications are made of abstractions,
depending on how independently an abstraction translates axioms, inference rules, etc.
A large section explaining how various peoples' work fits into this framework follows.
Then sections follow on inconsistent abstract spaces, operations performed
on abstractions, ordering abstractions, hierarchies of abstraction spaces, and building
abstractions.

Green describes using a theorem prover, QA3, to build a question-answering system.  Both statements and questions are written in FOL.  Questions can be True/False or Constructive (i.e. ask for an x such that ...).  Constructive answers are produced by adding the rule question-of-user(x) => Answer(x).  Green goes on to describe what we now call deductive plan synthesis, i.e. answer extraction of situation calculus axioms.  QA3 uses subsumption, duplicate literal elimination, unit preference, a variant on set of support, and no equality (yet).

Greiner and Elkan give axes upon which a representation, i.e. black box
for answering questions, can be evaluated: accuracy (how often the answer
given is correct), categoricity (how often the answer is I don't know), and
efficiency. A representation is thus evaluated wrt a query stream.  This 
external form of evaluation captures what any system using a representation
system actually cares about -- how well that representation works.  The
internal representation might also be evaluated by, for example, its
conciseness or elegance, but that is not covered here.  They also formalize
all bounded, linearly separable utility measures, i.e. ways of combining
evaluations wrt the 3 axes above.  Finally the authors confront statistical
approaches for performing evaluation, comparing representations, and improving
existing representations.   Well written.

Haas describes an approach for reasoning about belief, both an agent's own
beliefs and another agent's belief's.  First, we represent an agent's belief's
with Believes(agent, sentence), where sentence names a sentence of FOL.  Haas
names sentences of FOL by quoting each component, i.e. p(a) is named 'p('a)
(it looks cleaner in prefix notation).  He also gives names for intervals of
time so he can state how long it will take for an agent to believe a certain
sentence; afterall inference is not instantaneous.   In order to give an agent
the ability to determine what another agent will infer, Haas borrows
Konolige's suggestion of implanting an agent's inference rules into the
Believes statements.  Then, Haas introduces The Reflection Schema to do
inference.  Specifically,
Ax1,..,xn. (ClosedTerm x1)^...^(ClosedTerm xn) => IsProof(s)
s is a proof quoted appropriately.  He shows this schema sound and complete.
Haas goes on to define 'Knowing What' in terms of the context of what was asked.
'Knowing How' means a robot has a program to execute.  Finally, Haas connnects
belief and truth using the truth predicate: 'true(quote p) 'iff 'p.  The
Liar's paradox shows up here, but Haas avoids it by proving if p is ground,
true produces no contradictions.

Hahnle et. al. first describe connection graph resolution for
propositional logic, introduced by Kowalski in 1975.  
CGR begins with a graph of clauses with
edges between complementary literals.  Activating an edge
means performing a step of resolution, producing a new 
clause graph.  Then they show that ordered resolution
is a special case of cg-resolution (for prop logic) and then
that ordered cg-resolution will always terminate.  Ordered
cg-resolution enforces a total ordering on literals so
that resolution is applied only to the maximally ordered
literal in a clause.  It is a little unclear to what extent
the results are new, but apparently
the proofs are simpler than those given in the past.  At the end,
the authors discuss issues for lifting this to first-order and
give Eisinger's example that shows unrestricted cg-resolution
is non-terminal.

Halevy's survey splits the work that answers queries using views into two
cateogires: using materialized views to speed up query answering and
data integration.  In the former setting, materialized views have the potential
to speed up query answering because some portion of the query may have already
been computed and stored in the db as a materialized view.  The goal here is
to produce an efficient execution plan that uses base tables and materialized views.
In the latter setting, data integration techniques provide a schema, sometimes
called the mediated schema, for a user to query a large number of separate
databases.  To define how each individual schema relates to the mediated schema,
the tables in the individual schemas are expressed as views of the mediated schema.
Here the work focuses on rewriting the query in terms of the views of the mediated
schema, i.e. in terms of the database schema that actually exist.  This case is
particularly interesting because it requires the views to be treated as
incomplete, e.g. both the database of american cars and the database of foreign
cars contribute to the car table.

Halpern and Vardi prescribe using a semantic model to represent an agent's
knowledge and use model checking to determine logical entailment.  This differs
greatly from the standard approach of using logical sentences to represent
knowledge and then doing theorem proving to check entailment.  The authors
outline constructing such models in a few contexts and consider problems with
the model checking.

We outline the approach and discuss both the benefits of the approach as well as its limitations, and highlight certain unresolved issues that require further work. We demonstrate the viability of this approach using an e-Commerce site as an example, and provide results on the complexity and time required to solve for the configuration of such an application.

In Herbrand logic, arithmetic using the natural numbers if finitely axiomatizable; however, neither entailment nor satisfiability are semi-decidable. Nevertheless, four of the most industrially successful applications of logic in computer science have been built within fragments of Herbrand logic: deductive databases, logic programming, constraint satisfaction, and formal verification. In this paper, we define Herbrand logic formally, prove several of its properties, discuss Goedel&#39;s incompleteness result with respect to Herbrand logic, and demonstrate how each of the four applications mentioned above can be formalized within Herbrand logic.

    (paper.description hinrichs2007thesis "Relational databases have had great industrial success in computer science; however, most automated theorem provers today do not take advantage of database query engines and therefore do not routinely leverage that source of power. Extensional Reasoning is an approach to automated deduction where the system automatically translates an entailment query expressed in classical logic into a query about a database system so that the answers to the two queries are the same. To prove the theorem, the system then evaluates the database query using an off-the-shelf database. 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Extensional Reasoning was developed because many problems can be solved efficiently using a database but are naturally expressed using classical logic. In some cases, database query engines solve the database version of the query orders of magnitude faster than traditional theorem proving techniques solve the classical version. Extensional Reasoning helps us build systems that allow a non-expert to write problems down naturally, convert those problems to efficient representations automatically, and solve those problems using industrial-strength systems. 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conceptually, algorithms for performing Extensional Reasoning can be broken into two classes: those for complete theories and those for incomplete theories. A complete theory, one that can answer all the questions in its vocabulary, corresponds naturally to a relational database. Algorithms for this class of theories must recognize the theory is complete and then construct the appropriate database system. In the context of a logic with a finite domain, I present incomplete but low-order polynomial-time algorithms for performing these tasks. An incomplete theory, one for which there is some question in the vocabulary that cannot be answered, does not correspond naturally to a database system, and so the algorithms for performing Extensional Reasoning are more complex. In this case my approach is to construct a new, complete theory that captures the information pertinent to the original problem---a novel form of theory-completion. I present algorithms for performing this type of theory-completion in the same finite logic.")

Collaborative Programming languages differ from traditional programming languages because instruction sets can be incomplete and conflicting. An incomplete instruction set may only say what to do some of the time or what actions the system is forbidden from performing. A conflicting instruction set may simultaneously instruct the system to perform some action and forbid the system from performing that same action.  Technology that supports Collaborative Programming must be able to combine independently authored instruction sets and be tolerant of incompleteness and conflicts.  This paper introduces Collaborative Programming and through the discussion of two practical examples argues that tools from logic and automated reasoning form a good foundation for Collaborative Programming technology.

    (paper.description hinrichs2008design "While traditional network security policies have been enforced by manual configuration of individual network components such as router ACLs, firewalls, NATs and VLANs, emerging enterprise network designs and products support global policies declared over high level abstractions. We further the evolution of simpler and more powerful network security mechanisms by designing, implementing, and testing a flow-based network security policy language and enforcement infrastructure. Our policy language, FSL, expresses basic network access controls, directionality in communication establishment (similar to NAT), network isolation (similar to VLANs), communication paths, and rate limits. FSL supports modular construction, distributed authorship, and efficient implementation. We have implemented FSL as the primary policy language for NOX, a network-wide control platform, and have deployed it within an operational network for over 10 months. We describe how supporting complex policy objectives and meeting the demanding performance requirements of network-wide policy enforcement have influenced the FSL language design and implementation.

Each edge in the graph corresponds to data input/output flow.  Focused on SQL queries as examples.  The language for describing graphs was designed to support a library of idioms--thus, graphs can be built out of subgraphs.  Also, object classes are provided (in C  ) to make writing the algorithms at vertices relatively simple.  Use a couple of data-communication paradigms: files and TCP most notable.  For some reason I haven't discerned, there is/will be capabilities for the communication graph to be changed at runtime.  The system can take this into account because the job scheduler is constantly mapping nodes in the graph to processors; changing that set mid-computation seems not to be too problematic.  Language is actually built, deployed, and has several users.")

Every rule has associated with it a set of constraints

framework, but this is the seminal paper.  Solution to a CLP problem
is a set of constraints; thus, logic programming is a special form
of CLP where those constraints must be equality constraints.

from another set of relations.  They show how to compute which algebraic 
operators are closed for a given set of relations by solving a particular
kind of CSP for the given relations.  Then they show that the set of
relations definable from a given set is equal to the set of relations
that are closed under the same operations as that given set.  If some set
R is closed under the set of operations O and every operation in O is 
what they call essentially unary, the problem is NP-complete.  Moreover,
if O includes an operation that is not essentially unary, it includes
an operation that has arity at most max(3, the size of the domain).
Thus, this paper details sufficient conditions for checking whether
a particular CSP is NP-complete: (1) compute the set of operations
that are closed over the permissible tables in the constraints of the CSP.
(2) If that set includes just essentially-unary operations (which can
be deduced by checking for operations of arity up to max(3, size of domain), 
we are assured the problem is NP-complete.

This paper describes a method for determining entailment and abduction
through model-
checking for a KB of full propositional logic over a restricted set of 
queries.   It extends the work of Kautz, et. al. who wrote the seminal
work for propositional Horn KBs.  The definition for characteristic
models relies on Monotone Theory, which describes properties of 
Boolean functions.  It is important to note that these characteristic
models are defined with respect to a class of queries; that is, given
a class of queries, one can compute the characteristic models for
a propositional KB.  That set of models is then the optimal set, 
meaning all models are needed for correct entailment and abduction.
This paper does a thorough treatment of the issues it
brings up, but it is hard to penetrate.  Section 4 is a list of definitions
of Monotone theory, with little motivation or intuition as to the
utility of each definition.  Of course, the rest of the paper relies
on these definitions.  Reread!

Khardon builds on the previous work in kautz93 and khardon94 and investigates
the complexity of translating between propositional 
characteristic models and their
horn representations.  He shows that translating either way is polynomial-
reducible to the other, and that both are equivalent to deciding whether
a given set of models is the set of characteristic models of a given
set of horn clauses.  All these problems are at least as hard as converting
a monotone (no negations) CNF formula into a monotone DNF formula.  This
problem has a sub-exponential time solution of n^O(log n).
This paper also gives references to equivalent work in the database 
community under the name Armstrong relations.

This paper explains how model-based reasoning can be used to model reasoning
with context.  Suppose the KB is represented by a set of models M.  As the agent's
context changes, new sentences appear that define that context.  Entailment in
the context then means that the sentence holds in the subset of models M that
satisfy those new sentences.  By representing the theory as a set of models,
as context changes, that set can be reduced online.  In this paper, context
change is represented using default logic.  Algorithms are given for both
skeptical and credulous default reasoning where the knowledge base is represented
as a set of models.  Conditions are given under which these algorithms work
correctly.  Finally, the learning to reason paradigm is brought up as a third
argument for representing a KB as the set of models that satisfy it.  All three,
context, defaults, and learning to reason, sometimes produce computational
benefits because models are used to represent knowledge.

Reasoning with Examples means reasoning with enough models to correctly
determine entailment.  This technique shows up both in the database
literature under the name 'Armstrong Relations' and in the automated
reasoning literature under the name 'Characteristic Models'.  While
the latter refers to a set of examples, the former refers to a single
example.  The number of models needed in Characteristic Models for
propositional logic is bounded by |B|*|DNF(kb)|, where B is the 
basis for the knowledge base kb.  The bulk of this paper shows how the 
two concepts are closely intertwined; it goes on to show that finding 
the keys of a DB is akin to finding abductive explanations in a propositional
knowledge base.

The authors go through some of the work on partial evaluation in the case
of pure logic programming, which is called partial deduction.  (It differs
from partial evaluation in LP because axioms can be partially partially 
evaluated in the case of non-ground static arguments.)  Partial deduction
means constructing a partial SLDNF tree for a query, and using the fringe
to imply the goal as the output.  Interestingly, with negation, most work 
focuses on preserving operational semantics, as the well-founded semantics
are preserved for all groundings of the goal(s).  This paper focuses on
control issues surrounding the constructing of these SLDNF trees: (1)
given a goal atom A, how do we construct a tree, the local control
problem, and (2) what is the set of all goal atoms, the global control. 
The second problem only occurs because of the desire to preserve
procedural semantics.  The process of unfolding, i.e. constructing
the tree, is difficult because applying too many resolutions can 
result in local code explosion, work duplication, and non
termination.  If the unfold function is guaranteed to produce a tree 
with at most one non-failing
branch, it is said to be determinate; determine unfolding will not
produce code explosion or work duplication.  It is undecidable to determine
whether a tree with at most one non-failing branch can be constructed.
Approximations are usually used.   To deal with termination, binding-time
analysis is used (sometimes computed using abstract interpretation), which
creates annotations that have decided whether to unfold or not.  Instead of
handling termination offline, another approach handles it online--during
specialisation.  Well-founded and well-quasi orders are popular here.  
There is also a discussion of global control issues.  Interestingly,
tabling with partial deduction can turn a terminating program into
a nonterminating program.  Long reference list.

Intro: Classical planning doesn't deal with the problem of sensing or looping, e.g. it cannot produce plans that will successfully achieve the Airport or the Omlette examples.  Sensing is necessary iff there are properties of the world that cannot be deduced at plan time but that are required for achieving the goal.

<br><br>Classical Planning: Use sit calc to formally define the classical planning problem.  It is unclear to me whether the sit calc he is using would somehow allow there to be partial order plans, e.g. return something like (do (parallel a b c) (do (parallel e f) (do h s0))).  For now let's say it can't and sitcalc plans must be total orders.  We might argue that because his definition is tied to sitcalc, which produces only totally ordered plans, his 'definition' of the classical planning problem is wrong.  But it doesn't really matter for the rest of what he is going to say.

Incorporating sensing actions: gives an overview of another one of his papers which introduces sensing actions into sitcalc, and reviews some related work.

<br><br>Robot programs: introduces a language for describing plans that is more expressive than the standard sitcalc (do a (do b (do .... s0)))) and partial order languages.  Includes loops and branches.  He defines the semantics of the language in situation calculus, relying on a new second order construct for defining the semantics of a loop.  Finally, he states the first theorem, which amounts to a set of rewrite rules for each of the new constructs in the robot language, where the rewrite rules allow one to construct an interpreter for the language.  That is, the obvious interpreter for the language does the right thing, and the theorem proves that.

The revised planning task: formalize, using the machinery built up above, the planning problem as it includes loops, branches, and sensing.  Remember this is all sitcalc in first-order logic + a couple second-order constructs.  The rest of the section works through the Airport example.

<br><br>Note: Importantly, all the examples thusfar, as well as the definition of the planning task requires a _deductive_ solution.  That is, the airport example includes the axiom AtGate(a) | AtGate(b).  At plan-time we can prove that the plan (seq goto-airport (if check-gate(a) then goto-gate-a else goto-gate-b)) will work.  This is unlike our room reservation example since there may be no room to reserve, but we won't know that until plan execution time.  At plan-time, there is no plan we can prove will work.

<br><br>Are robot programs enough?: They claim the original plan language is not sufficient for expressing plans for every solvable planning problem.  The reason is that there is no memory available for the program to use.  Asking for a plan that returns the number of eggs it is given at runtime cannot be achieved without (infinite) memory.  Levesque adds 5 actions (left, right, mark, erase, read_mark) that can be used to expand the plans expressible by his robot language to include (he claims) everything that is computable.  That is, his planning language with these additional actions would force a planner to construct a Turing Machine that achieves the given goal.  Of course, that problem is undecidable.  

<br><br>A two sentence summary.  Levesque introduces a plan description language that includes branching and loops (with an extension that he claims makes the language Turing complete), for the simple reason that solving some real world planning problems requires sensing and looping.  He formalizes the planning problem as one of deduction, which has the benefit that deductive solutions will always be right but has the drawback that it eliminates plans that we might expect a machine to produce, e.g. room reservation.

Datalog with constraints differs from traditional datalog in that in addition to predicates defined within the datalog program, there are predicates with a semantics fixed from outside the logic.  The algorithm for processing datalog with constraints amalgamates constraints as it goes; an inconsistent set of constraints requires backtracking in a top-down implementation.  The authors may have introduced a very general class of datalog with constraints for the first time here, but that is unclear.  Next the authors give sufficient conditions for classes of constraints that are tractable, i.e. any datalog program using constraints just from the class can be evaluated in time polynomial in the size of the program.  (This is confusing since traditional datalog isn't always polynomial in the size of the program because of recursion, unless I'm mistaken.)  At any rate, unary, linearly decomposable constraints are better behaved than others.  The definition of linearly decomposable escapes me, however.  It is shown that not all unary constraints are linearly decomposable.  The authors go on to show how some of their previous work (RT) can be expressed in datalog with constraints using linearly decomposable constraints, and do some analysis of KeyNote, a TM system that deals with delegation.")

A runtime monitor then transforms an input sequence to an output sequence so that the output sequence obeys the policy.  The authors prove that certain types of policies can be enforced by certain kinds of monitors.")

    (paper.description lopezgarcia2004 "
In the context of Logic programming, the authors consider two problems:
(1) detecting whether a relation will ever return more than one answer
through all control paths, i.e. whether the relation is determinate,
 and (2) determining whether more than one
rule with for a relation will ever be satisfied for
the same query, i.e. whether the rules defining that relation
are mutually exclusive.  Addressing these questions relies on type
information, i.e. all the possible queries asked for a relation, and
mode information, i.e. whether a variable is used for validation or
for generation.  For r to be determinate, it is sufficient
that every relation that is a subgoal of r be mutually exclusive.
Thus an approximation of (1) can be accomplished by computing (2).  The test
for mutual exclusion offered here will return true only when all the 
rules for a relation contain procedural attachments that can be shown
to be mutually exclusive for all the types of the relation.  Experimental
results are shown for the case where the procedural attachments are
equality/distinction/inequality.

induction axiom).  The problem with Manna's recursion lies in the need for what he calls
Generalization, i.e. automatically strengthening the stated goal.  Manna also deals
with equality by building it into the unification algorithm.

STeP is a verification system that proves first order temporal

It combines equational and arithmetic simplification, model 
checking, interactive first-order theorem proving, and automatic
invariant generation.  The model checking is done through 
Streett automaton and behavior automaton.  The first-order
theorem proving is automated with non-clausal resolution
and paramodulation and utilizes lemmas.  The interactive
theorem proving is handled with a Gentzen-style prover:
both first-order and temporal first-order.  Propositional
temporal formulas can be automatically verified.
This paper is well-written and clear, but assumes knowledge
of temporal logic and transition systems.

The basic situation calculus paper.  McCarthy and Hayes consider not only the classic planning environment (fully-observable), but also a partially-observable one, introducing what are now referred to as 'sensing actions'.  They attempt a self-proclaimed ad-hoc approach to handling these sensing actions.  They also point out the frame problem, alluding to a state vector as a possible solution.  The qualification problem (though they don't name it that) shows up here, along with the introduction of the modal operators consistent(phi), probably(phi), and normally(phi) as a tentative solution avenue.  Finally, McCarthy and Hayes look into embedding Modal Logic, Logic of Knowledge (Hintikka), Tense Logics, and a couple of others into situation calculus.

Example: one might say to use DES or AES, and the other wants to use just DES.  The resulting policy uses DES.  Additionally, the paper considers the problem of checking whether an active policy complies with a group's policy, handling the case when a session is already underway and another party wants to join.

The model checking problem is to determine if a sentence s is entailed

that continually interact with their environment.  These systems are usually
modelled with a Kripke structure or an omega(Buchi)-Automaton.  The sentence s 
is usually written in Propositional Temporal Logic (PTL) (which allows only
universal statements), Computation Tree Logic (CTL) (which allows 
universal and existential statements), CTL*, or propositional mu-calculus.
PTL and CTL are not comparable (neither is more expressive than the other).
CTL* is strictly more expressive than CTL and PTL, and propositional
mu-calculus subsumes CTL*.  Model checking algorithms can either be local
(PTL), global (CTL), or symbolic.  Symbolic formulas can be represented
with ordered binary decision diagrams.

and conditions under which variables need not be assigned values.  For 
every variable vi there is a propositional constant active:vi.  If 
active:vi must hold given the values of other variables, vi must
be assigned a value.  If ~active:vi must hold, vi need not be assigned
a value.  It is unclear what happens if neither active:vi nor ~active:vi 
holds.  They use an assumption-based truth maintenance system to build
a Dynamic CSP solver.

introduce a new variable, replace the term with that variable, and include
the sentence where that variable is set to the term in the appropriate

is unsatisfiable.  Otherwise, compute all the strongest equality theorems

a particular sentence; moreover, for ground literals, satisfaction is decidable
since either the literal or its negation must be consistent and the 
clauseset is satisfiable, exactly one is consistent, which ensures one
is inconsistent.  Any off-the- shelf first-order entailment algorithm will 
find an inconsistency.  The technique is based on predicate completion,
which only works when there is a strict ordering among the clauses.

Occurrences are sequences of events that really do happen in every hypothetical branch of the situation tree.  In deductive plan synthesis via the Green method, we want all plans returned to include all the occurrences given.  Pinto names two specific types of occurrences: narratives (a partial specification of a sequence of events known to happen) and triggers (as in the database sense).  His formulation assigns time values to situations, a second order induction axiom, along with an extension to the sitcalc ontology to define &#39;nonpreventable occurrences&#39;, &#39;conditional occurrences&#39;, and &#39;simple occurrences&#39;.  He defines &#39;legal(s)&#39; in terms of these 3 occurrence types to mean that a situation s includes all the mentioned occurrences and is a valid sitcalc situation.  Pinto goes on to define when one situation is preferred to another: s preferred-to s&#39; iff s&#39; has the same actions as s with extra actions appended to the end.  For planning, Pinto shows that instead of finding an s s.t. goal(s) is true, we can find an s s.t. goal(s) ^ legal(s) is true.

using more than one abstraction at a time.  Using these abstractions admits

In the context of Horn prolog with built-ins, the authors address the
problem of efficiently unfolding of recursive relations.  That is,
one implementation of partial evaluation/partial deduction is to produce
a partial SLD tree and using the fringe as the body of a rule for proving
the goal.  The problem with this approach is that the recursive relations 
produce infinite SLD trees, unless the recursion is cut off.  To determine
when the recursion should be cut off, a common practice is to apply a
recursive rule only when the subgoal is smaller, according to some
ordering, e.g. well-founded, well-quasi, than all its ancestors.  To
implement that, all the ancestors of each goal have in the past 
been stored, which is expensive both in time to check and in space
to store.  This paper tackles this problem by expanding the tree in a 
variant of depth-first search so that only the current call stack need
be stored.  They also consider the case of built-in predicates.

Reiter characterized as implicit semantics.

are a finite number of object constants, no function constants, and when
written in prenex form include no existential quantifiers.
To do so he (1) shows that existential queries will never require
the DCA, for algorithms exploiting Herbrand&#39;s theorem, and 
(2) how to build on this fact 
to answer any kind of query by peeling away quantifiers to build an 
existential query.  The second step uses a generalization of the 
relational database division operator for universal quantifiers and a 
generalization of the projection operator for existential quantifiers. 
Next it is shown that Horn databases and positive existential queries never 
require computing disjunctive answers. 
Then conditions are given for the removal of all but the x=x equality axiom: 
E-saturation, i.e.
unique names over all the constants.  Lastly it is
shown that extending DCA to include infinitely many constants can result in
an infinite disjunction as an answer to a query.  Very thorough, as always.

the action precondition axiom; R(do(a,s)) is the fluent, r_pos(a,s) is the
positive effect axiom for R; r_neg(a,s) is the negative effect axiom for R.
This works when also given a single definition for Poss(A,s) for each action A,
unique naming axioms for actions and states.  This technique requires F A
axioms instead of 2*A*F axioms to describe frame and effect axioms for a
domain, where F is the number of fluents and A the number of actions.
Reiter also discusses a regression operator, which does deductive plan synthesis by taking a normal situation calculus axiomitization (using successor state axioms) and rewrites it so that every fluent only mentions S0.  Under certain conditions, Reiter shows that the rewriting can be done iff Es.G(s).

Suppose the clause C can be partitioned into 2 parts D and E, where each

C with the clauses D | p and E | -p.  This only makes sense when there
is an ordering imposed on the literals so that p and -p are not immediately
resolved together undoing the work of splitting.  The authors investigate
two orders: blocking and parallel.  In blocking, the -p literals 
are ranked highest; the non p literals are ranked next with negative
bigger than positive; the p atoms are ranked lowest.  In parallel,
the p literals (positive or negative) are ranked last.  Also, 
these p literals are considered names.  If there is another clause 
C&#39; with partition D and F, then C&#39; is split into F | -p.  Some
experimental results from TPTP show that splitting is a bad idea
with equality but that Parallel ordering with Naming is a good idea
without equaity.

In 1969, McCarthy and Hayes&#39; asserted that knowledge representation should be epistemologically adequate and also define heuristic adequacy.  Sufficiently complex problems contain too many details to be epistemologically adequate and have adequeate heuristics.  To that end, Sacerdoti first plans through an abstract plan space and then refines a solution in that space to ensure the details support the abstraction.  To implement this idea, Sacerdoti extends STRIPS by assigning &#39;criticality&#39; measures to each precondition of an action.  These measures define a hierarchy of abstraction spaces.  The planner finds a solution at the highest level of abstraction, and proceeds recursively to the next highest level.  Control of the search (i.e. the cost assigned to nodes in the search space) changes based on the level of abstraction.

Sandford describes a new refinement of semantic resolution, hereditary 
lock resolution, and a new approach for representing models as required 
in semantic resolution.  The pertinent part of the work is the model 
representation.  Semantic resolution puts clauses into two bins throughout 
the resolution process.  Part of the input to the procedure is a model, 
any model, and those clauses that are satisfied by the model are put into 
bin 1 while clauses not satisfied by the model are put into bin 2.  
This partitioning of clauses shrinks the search space since every resolution 
must use at least one clause from the set of unsatisfied clauses.  
Sandford describes a method for using a set of sentences to define that 
model (in possibly a totally different language) and using a satisfaction 
test to determine whether a clause belongs in bin 1 or 2.   Of course, 
the computational and complexity properties could be horrible, but so 
long as the satisfaction test is sound (only returns true when the sentences 
and clause are satisfiable), we retain completeness.

Shostak describes what is now commonly known as Shostak's decision procedure.
The decision procedure works on algebraically solvable and canonizable 
equational theories.  It functions by computing the congruence closure of 
the terms in the language representing each one by their canonical forms.  
The canonization takes into account both interpreted and unintepreted
functions.  Unlike Nelson Oppen, Shostak shows how to merge the decision
procedures for two theories by taking a solver and canonizer for each and
building a single solver and canonizer pair for the union of the theories.

Slaney describes a case study of SCOTT (Semantically Constrained
Otter).  SCOTT consists of OTTER augmented with a model-generator
FINDER.  It restricts the resolutions done by Otter to include one
parent clause not true in the model being generated.  A new model
is generated every time a new clause is generated that is false
in the current model (up to 100 clauses).  If no new model can 
be found, the old one is used.  SCOTT retains completeness
for binary resolution since every model generated is a model of the
usable list (those axioms assumed to be consistent).

This is really only possible in an environment without sensing actions with continuous return values.  Soutchanski also points out that only a single policy can be computed for an entire program, even if the program could be easily partitioned into two independent portions.  Soutchanski introduces optimize(p1);p2 to indicate that a single policy should be found for program p1 and another for program p2.  He also gives a new formulation of sensing actions of the form sense(act, value, s), meaning the result of executing the action act is value in situation s.  Since Golog is an online interpreter, sensing actions with continuous return values can be handled.

Tinelli shows how to use theory reasoning to combine specialized reasoners in
a sound and complete way in the context of semantic tableaus.  The theories
those reasoners embody must be universal, a requirement for theory reasoning.
Tinelli's results hinge on an interpolation lemma that
requires all the background theory signatures to include all the
same functions.   This lemma shows that determining unsatisfiability of
wrt a set of theories requires only passing disjunctions of literals in
the common signature among the theories.  One can thus alter the tableau
procedure by allowing a new type of derivation: hand off a subset of the
literals on a particular branch which are of the appropriate signature
to the corresponding background reasoner.  If the reasoner returns
'unsatisfiable', close the branch; otherwise, add the residue to the
end of the branch.

and work your way up.  Datalog (prolog w/o negation or functions)
is given the fixed-point semantics.  When extended with negation,
the least-fixed-point semantics are troublesome; stratified negation
and well-founded semantics have been developed to handle this.
Query containment of conjunctive queries is NP complete in general,
but is linear if no predicate appears more than twice in any
query.  Whether a conjunctive query is contained in a Datalog
program is exponential, and the reverse is decidable.  Rewriting
a query in terms of views has been done when the views are 
conjunctive queries as well as when the views are described
by Datalog programs.

Uribe surveys combinations of model checkers and theorem provers in the

explaining transition systems, fair transition systems,
finite-state model checking, deductive verification, abstraction, and
invariant generation.   Then Uribe discusses loosely coupled systems,
which treat the model checker/theorem prover as a black box. Modularity
and abstraction, general deductive environments (debugging, incremental
verification, and formal decomposition), and abstraction generation using
theorem proving have all been investigated in this loosely-coupled way.  
Lastly he considers tightly coupled systems.  Diagram-based
formalisms provide abstractions.  Model checking infinite-state systems
can also be attacked with abstraction.  A handful of tightly integrated
systems are also mentioned.  This survey feels like it is made up of a
hodge-podge of attempts--whether that is characteristic of the field
or the paper is unclear.

In the context of logic programming over Horn rules, 
Vanhoof considers three problems: (1) determining when some portion
of a rule body is equivalent to a portion of another rule body, (2) 
determining when two relations are identical up to argument permutation,
and (3) whether two portions of rule bodies share enough functionality
to be generalized as a higher-order rule, e.g. mapcar.  The nice
part about this topic of semantic equivalence in LP is that two
relations/conjunctions are equivalent iff they have the same extensions.
Vanhoof gives approximation algorithms, i.e. algorithms that are 
sufficient, for determining various kinds of semantic equivalences.

operate on another LS pair.   Metametalevel reasoning

    (paper.description zheng2003using "To secure distributed systems in the context of heterogeneous trust, this paper introduces techniques that take high-level, non-distributed code and an information-flow security policy and generate distributed subprograms that implemented the original code and satisfy that policy.  The techniques leverage replication for data integrity  and secure hash replicas to enforce confidentiality.")
