to break a clause apart when variables are not shared between pieces.
Suppose the clause C can be partitioned into 2 parts D and E, where each

C with the clauses D | p and E | -p.  This only makes sense when there
is an ordering imposed on the literals so that p and -p are not immediately
resolved together undoing the work of splitting.  The authors investigate
two orders: blocking and parallel.  In blocking, the -p literals 
are ranked highest; the non p literals are ranked next with negative
bigger than positive; the p atoms are ranked lowest.  In parallel,
the p literals (positive or negative) are ranked last.  Also, 
these p literals are considered names.  If there is another clause

their definition of a basic action theory to include knowledge-producing
actions.  Namely, a knowledge-action theory D_e = Sigma_e U D_ss U D_ap U D_una
U D_S0 U D_sf U D_k0.  Sigma_e is an expanded set of foundational axioms; D_ss
are the successor state axioms; D_ap are the action precondition axioms;
D_una are the unique name axioms for actions; D_s0 is the initial situation;
D_k0 is an initial knowldge axiom (what the agent knows in S0).  This stuff
gets pretty messy, but eventually they provide a solution to the knowledge
frame problem, i.e. a complete specification of how knowledge changes as the
result of performing any action.

This paper confronts termination in term-rewriting systems.  
Dershowitz first defines the notion of a non-terminating rewrite system,
i.e. one with an infinite homeomorphic self-embedding derivation.  Then
he defines a simplification ordering as a partial ordering with
the replacement (monotonicity), subterm, and deletion properties.  If there
is a simplification ordering for a term rewriting system such that l > r for
every rewrite rule l -> r then the rewrite system terminates.  Dershowitz
goes on to define a quasi-simplification ordering, which is weaker than
a simplification ordering, making it easier to prove rewrite systems
terminate.  The reason this paper is located in this section is that
the notion of a recursive path ordering is then defined.  RPO and
variants thereof are used in modern theorem provers when ordering
is necessary.  The last section goes through a series of examples
that demonstrate how to prove rewrite systems terminate.

an evaluator for first order logic that combines the rewrite rules with
the semantic attachments to do proofs.  FOL is a system that operates on
'LS pairs': a set of logical sentences, a set of attachments, and a set
of facts.  Because this is done uniformly, FOL allows multiple LS pairs
to be defined at the same time.  A special LS pair, Meta, is a theory
of LS pairs; reflection is achieved in FOL by allowing Meta to
operate on another LS pair.   Metametalevel reasoning

Reiter explores techniques for doing first-order reasoning with

(x=a1 | x=a2 | ... | x=an).  He focuses on axiom sets for which there
are a finite number of object constants, no function constants, and when
written in prenex form include no existential quantifiers.
To do so he (1) shows that existential queries will never require
the DCA, for algorithms exploiting Herbrand's theorem, and 
(2) how to build on this fact 
to answer any kind of query by peeling away quantifiers to build an 
existential query.  The second step uses a generalization of the 
relational database division operator for universal quantifiers and a 
generalization of the projection operator for existential quantifiers. 
Next it is shown that Horn databases and positive existential queries never 
require computing disjunctive answers. 
Then conditions are given for the removal of all but the x=x equality axiom: 
E-saturation, i.e.
unique names over all the constants.  Lastly it is
shown that extending DCA to include infinitely many constants can result in
an infinite disjunction as an answer to a query.  Very thorough, as always.

Reiter formalizes Database theory from a logical perspective.  Databases in this view are first-order models, and integrity constraints are sentences that such a model satisfies.  A relational theory (the set of sentences entailed by a relational database) can be defined as the set of ground atoms in the DB, a completion axiom for each table ensuring that those ground atoms not in the table are false, unique-names axioms, a domain closure axiom, and equality/substitution axioms.   Proof is provided.  Next Reiter goes on to generalize this definition to handle positive disjunction, which requires altering the completion axioms.  Lastly he shows how to deal with null values by changing the DCA and the completion axioms.

he gives algorithms for automatically decomposing theories, based on
