(POS (PAPER.DESCRIPTION BALZAROTTI2007MIMOSA "To find vulnerabilities in web apps, the authors consider two problems: an attacker finds a path through the application's web pages that the developer did not intend and there is a data-flow vulnerability that crosses server module boundaries.  Both involve crossing module boundaries on the server.  The intended path problem is interesting in that both the possible paths and the intended paths are extracted from the server automatically in this paper.  The data-flow stuff seems pretty standard, but for the fact that they are considering multi-step (multi-URL) attacks.  Use a mix of static and dynamic analysis together with model checking. "))

Conceptually, Resin requires the programmers define filter objects to check whether data flowing over a boundary is permitted to do so (e.g. sent over the network, written to a file, etc.).  The programmer annotates sensitive data with policy objects.  Data tracking is performed by Resin directly."))

In this position paper we argue that the formal verification community would be well-served by developing theory, algorithms, implementations, and applications that combine model checking and runtime verification into a single, seamless technology.  This technology would allow system developers to carefully choose the appropriate balance between offline verification of expressive properties (model checking) and online verification of important parts of the system&#39;s state space (runtime verification).  We present several realistic examples where such technology appears necessary and a preliminary formalization of the idea.

apply previous work in access control evaluation, as well as lessons learned
from evaluation frameworks used in other domains. We describe the analysis
components required by such a framework, the challenges involved in building it,
and our preliminary work in realizing this ambitious goal. We then theorize
about other areas within the security domain that display a similar absence of
such evaluation tools, and consider ways in which we can adapt our framework to
analyze these broader types of security workloads.
