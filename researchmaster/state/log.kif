Oivos uses database operations, essentially, to allow the programmer to declaratively specify how an initial set of tables should be transformed to a new set a tables.  Those database operations are then compiled into low-level file-level operations that are scheduled on massively parallel machines.  Experiments showed that by increasing the expressiveness of the language and therefore enabling a larger portion of the entire program to be encoded, the system could reduce the number of synchronization points, thereby improving efficiency/throughput."))

We outline the approach and discuss both the benefits of the approach as well as its limitations, and highlight certain unresolved issues that require further work. We demonstrate the viability of this approach using an e-Commerce site as an example, and provide results on the complexity and time required to solve for the configuration of such an application.

Collaborative Programming languages differ from traditional programming languages because instruction sets can be incomplete and conflicting. An incomplete instruction set may only say what to do some of the time or what actions the system is forbidden from performing. A conflicting instruction set may simultaneously instruct the system to perform some action and forbid the system from performing that same action.  Technology that supports Collaborative Programming must be able to combine independently authored instruction sets and be tolerant of incompleteness and conflicts.  This paper introduces Collaborative Programming and through the discussion of two practical examples argues that tools from logic and automated reasoning form a good foundation for Collaborative Programming technology.

However (1) I get the impression that they haven't gone further than writing the paper and (2) they are concerned with performing actions on the network in response to human events rather than network events. They are trying to replace today's plethora of configuration tools with a single, global configuration tool.  We are also creating a global configuration tool but at a higher level of abstraction than today's networks provide (routing based on user/host/ap).  That higher-level of abstraction makes our global configuration tool (FML) harder to construct because it must operate at line speed, not human speed.

In addition to defining regular languages as one might expect, HAMPI allows context free grammars to be defined (and then limited to a fixed length to ensure the language is regular).

Relational databases have had great industrial success in computer science. The power of the paradigm is made clear both by its widespread adoption and by theoretical analysis. Today, automated theorem provers are not able to take advantage of database query engines and therefore do not routinely leverage that source of power. Extensional Reasoning (ER) is an approach to automated theorem proving where the machine automatically translates a logical entailment query into a database, a set of view definitions, and a database query such that the entailment query can be answered by answering the database query. The techniques developed for ER to date are applicable only when the logical theory is axiomatically complete.

We further the evolution of simpler and more powerful network security mechanisms by designing, implementing, and testing a flow-based network security policy language and enforcement infrastructure. Our policy language, FSL, expresses basic network access controls, directionality in communication establishment (similar to NAT), network isolation (similar to VLANs), communication paths, and rate limits. FSL supports modular construction, distributed authorship, and efficient implementation. We have implemented FSL as the primary policy language for NOX, a network-wide control platform, and have deployed it within an operational network for over 10 months. We describe how supporting complex policy objectives and meeting the demanding performance requirements of network-wide policy enforcement have influenced the FSL language design and implementation.

The degree to which the information gained by learning in the source is useful for the target is dependent on the relationship between source and target tasks.  This paper proposes mathematical definitions for the relationships investigated in DARPA&#39;s Transfer Learning program."))

This paper presents Plato, a compiler that automatically generates web forms that detect errors and fill-in implied values from declarative web form descriptions.  Instead of writing HTML and JavaScript directly, web developers write an ontology in classical logic that describes the relationships between web form fields, 
and Plato automatically generates HTML to display the form and browser scripts to implement the requisite SAT solving and theorem proving.  We discuss Plato&#39;s design and implementation and evaluate Plato&#39;s performance both analytically and empirically.

The first rewrites each query, effectively folding the TBox into the query, sometimes resulting in exponential blowup.  The second rewrites the data plus the TBox, and then for each query rewrites it with the TBox.  This paper introduces algorithms for DL-Lite combined rewriting; the data rewriting is polynomial, and the query rewriting is exponential (though they identify a polynomial fragment).  Additionally, these algorithms are experimentally compared to existing query-rewriting algorithms.

(POS (PAPER.DESCRIPTION KONTCHAKOV2009COMBINED "Two approaches to reasoning about description logics with large Aboxes are compared for a DL-Lite description logic: query-only rewriting and combined-rewriting.  The first rewrites each query, effectively folding the TBox into the query, sometimes resulting in exponential blowup.  The second rewrites the data plus the TBox, and then for each query rewrites it with the TBox.  This paper introduces algorithms for DL-Lite combined rewriting; the data rewriting is polynomial, and the query rewriting is exponential (though they identify a polynomial fragment).  Additionally, these algorithms are experimentally compared to existing query-rewriting algorithms.
