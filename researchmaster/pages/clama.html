<h2>Computational Logic: A Modern Approach</h2>

<p><b>Logic Course Survey</b> (April 2010)
<p>The courses surveyed below are taught in Computer Science departments and include significant material on (computational) logic.  The hope is that some of these courses will utilize CLAMA in whole or in part.  I excluded Database courses, Programming Language courses, Security courses, Theory of Computation courses, and AI courses likely to utilize Stuart and Russell's AIAMA.  I've included formal methods courses because they apply logic to solve real-world problems, which is one of the themes of CLAMA.

<p>For the most part, I just looked through the course listings provided by each department.  It's possible that I missed relevant courses if (a) they are only taught periodically and (b) the course listing only covered the current year.

<p>Each course is ranked from 1 to 5 in terms of relevance to CLAMA, where 1 is most relevant and 5 is least relevant.  General scheme:
<ol>
<li>Standard knowledge representation and reasoning course.  Importantly, these courses cover a mix of KRR topics, e.g. classical logic, Prolog, theorem proving, and answer set programming.
<li>An in-depth focus on one aspect of KRR but drawn from the same pool of topics as (1).  Classical logic, finite model theory, theorem-proving.  Or AI with a mix of logic and statistical AI that might be amenable to CLAMA for the logic portion of the course.
<li>Individual topics further removed from classical KRR, e.g. modal logic or automated reasoning for built-in theories (e.g. bit arithmetic).
<li>Formal methods, i.e. applying KRR to hardware/software.  Usually includes model checking and often includes theorem proving.
<li>Everything else, but mainly logical techniques designed for programming language semantics/analysis.
</ol>

Basic operations.
