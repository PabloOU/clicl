<HTML><HEAD><TITLE> Strings </TITLE></HEAD><BODY><HR><H2>Standard Information Format Specification</H2><H2>Chapter 5: Characters and Strings </H2><HR><H3>Characters</H3>A character is a printed symbol, such as a digit or a letter.  There are128 distinct characters known to KIF, corresponding to the 128 possiblecombinations of bits in the ASCII encoding.  In KIF, there are two ways torefer to characters.<P>The first method is use of <TT><B>charref</B></TT> syntax, i.e. thecharacters <TT>#</TT> and <TT>\</TT>, followed by the character to berepresented.<P>While this method works for all 128 characters, it is less than ideal fordocuments like this one, because of the difficulty of writing outnon-printing characters.  Using this method, it is also difficult to assertproperties of some classes of characters.  For this reason, KIF supports analternative method of specification, viz. the use of the 7 bit codecorresponding to the character.The following paragraphs describe the relations relevant to characters.<P><DT><TT>character</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(character <B>t</B>)</TT> is trueif and only if <TT><B>t</B></TT> denotes a character.<P><DT><TT>alphabetic</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(alphabetic <B>t</B>)</TT> is trueif and only if <TT><B>t</B></TT> denotes an alphabetic character.<P><DT><TT>uppercase</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(uppercase <B>t</B>)</TT> is trueif and only if <TT><B>t</B></TT> denotes an upper case character.<P><DT><TT>lowercase</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(lowercase <B>t</B>)</TT> is trueif and only if <TT><B>t</B></TT> denotes a lower case character.<P><DT><TT>digit</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(digit <B>t</B>)</TT> is trueif and only if <TT><B>t</B></TT> denotes a digit.<P><DT><TT>alphanumeric</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(alphanumeric <B>t</B>)</TT> is trueif and only if <TT><B>t</B></TT> denotes an alphanumeric character.<P><DT><TT>chargreater</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(chargreater <B>t1</B> <B>t2</B>)</TT> is trueif and only if the character denoted by <TT><B>t1</B></TT> lexicographicallysucceeds the character denoted by <TT><B>t2</B></TT>.<P><DT><TT>charless</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(charless <B>t1</B> <B>t2</B>)</TT> is trueif and only if the character denoted by <TT><B>t1</B></TT> lexicographicallyprecedes the character denoted by <TT><B>t2</B></TT>.</DL><H3>Strings</H3>A <I>string</I> is a list of characters.<P>One way of referring to strings is through the use of the<TT><B>string</B></TT> syntax described in chapter 2.  In thismethod, we refer to the string <TT>abc</TT> by enclosing it in doublequotes, i.e. <TT>"abc"</TT>.<P>A second way is through the use of character blocks, the<TT><B>block</B></TT> syntax described in chapter 2.  In thismethod, we refer to the string <TT>abc</TT> by prefixing with thecharacter <TT>#</TT>, a positive integer indicating the length, the letter<TT>q</TT>, and the characters of the string, i.e. <TT>#3qabc</TT>.The following paragraphs describe the relations relevant to strings.<DL><P><DT><TT>makestring</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(makestring <B>t1</B> <B>t</B>)</TT> is true if and only if<TT><B>t</B></TT> denotes the string corresponding to the expression<TT><B>t1</B></TT>.<P><DT><TT>convertfromstring</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(convertfromstring <B>t1</B> <B>t</B>)</TT> is true if andonly if <TT><B>t</B></TT> is the expression corresponding to the string denotedby <TT><B>t1</B></TT>.<P><DT><TT>stringalphanumeric</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(stringappend <B>t1</B> <B>t</B>)</TT> is trueif and only if <B>t</B> denotes the string composed of the alphanumericcharacters in <TT><B>t1</B></TT>.<P><DT><TT>stringappend</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(stringappend <B>t1</B> ... <B>tn</B> <B>t</B>)</TT> istrue if and only if <B>t</B> denotes the concatenation of the strings denotedby  <TT><B>t1</B></TT> ... <B>tn</B>.<P><DT><TT>stringcapitalize</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(stringcapitalize <B>t1</B> <B>t</B>)</TT> is trueif and only if <B>t</B> denotes a copy of the string denoted by<TT><B>t1</B></TT> in which the initial character of every word is capitalized.<P><DT><TT>stringcharpos</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(stringcharpos <B>t1</B> <B>t2</B> <B>t</B>)</TT> is trueif and only if <B>t</B> denotes the position of the character denoted by <TT><B>t1</B></TT> in the string denoted by <TT><B>t2</B></TT>.<P><DT><TT>stringdowncase</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(stringdowncase <B>t1</B> <B>t</B>)</TT> is trueif and only if <B>t</B> denotes a copy of the string denoted by<TT><B>t1</B></TT> in which all alphbetic characters are lower case.<P><DT><TT>stringelement</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(stringelement <B>t1</B> <B>t2</B> <B>t</B>)</TT> is trueif and only if <B>t</B> denotes the character found in the string denoted by<TT><B>t1</B></TT> at the position denoted by <TT><B>t2</B></TT>.<P><DT><TT>stringgreater</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(stringgreater <B>t1</B> <B>t2</B>)</TT> is trueif and only if the string denoted by <TT><B>t1</B></TT> lexicographicallysucceeds the string denoted by <TT><B>t2</B></TT>.<P><DT><TT>string</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(string <B>t</B>)</TT> is trueif and only if <TT><B>t</B></TT> denotes a string.<P><DT><TT>stringlength</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(stringlength <B>t1</B> <B>t</B>)</TT> is trueif and only if <TT><B>t</B></TT> denotes the length of the string denoted by<TT><B>t1</B></TT>.<P><DT><TT>stringless</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(stringless <B>t1</B> <B>t2</B>)</TT> is trueif and only if the string denoted by <TT><B>t1</B></TT> lexicographicallyprecedes the string denoted by <TT><B>t2</B></TT>.<P><DT><TT>stringposition</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(stringposition <B>t1</B> <B>t2</B> <B>t</B>)</TT> is trueif and only if <TT><B>t</B></TT> denotes the string consisting of thecharacters from the string denoted by <TT><B>t1</B></TT> starting at theposition denoted by <TT><B>t2</B></TT> and ending at the position denoted by<TT><B>t3</B></TT>.<P><DT><TT>stringsubseq</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(stringsubseq <B>t1</B> <B>t2</B> <B>t3</B> <B>t</B>)</TT>is true if and only if the string denoted by <TT><B>t1</B></TT>lexicographically precedes the string denoted by <TT><B>t2</B></TT>.<P><DT><TT>stringsubstitute</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(stringsubstitute <B>t1</B> <B>t2</B> <B>t3</B><B>t</B>)</TT> is true if and only if <TT><B>t</B></TT> denotes a copy of thestring denoted by <TT><B>t3</B></TT> in which the character denoted by<TT><B>t1</B></TT> replaces every occurrence of the character denoted by<TT><B>t2</B></TT>.<P><DT><TT>stringupcase</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(stringupcase <B>t1</B> <B>t</B>)</TT> is trueif and only if <B>t</B> denotes a copy of the string denoted by<TT><B>t1</B></TT> in which all alphbetic characters are upper case.<P><DT><TT>substring</TT><DD>The sentence <TT>(substring <B>t1</B> <B>t2</B>)</TT> is trueif and only if the string denoted by <TT><B>t1</B></TT> is a substring of thestring denoted by <TT><B>t2</B></TT>.</DL><HR><ADDRESS><A HREF="mailto:genesereth@cs.stanford.edu">Michael R.
