In order to allow a user to express the idea that a functionis not meaningful for certain arguments, KIF assumes that there is a special"undefined" object in the universe and provides the object constant<TT>bottom</TT> to refer to this object.<P><H3>True and False</H3>The truth value of <TT>true</TT> is true, and the truth value of <TT>false</TT>is false.<P><H3>Equations and Inequalities</H3>An equation is true if and only if the terms in the equation refer to the same objectin the universe of discourse.<P>An inequality is true if and only if the terms in the equation refer to distinctobjects in the universe of discourse.<P><H3>Relational Sentences</H3>A simple relational sentence without a terminating sequence variable is trueif and only if the relation denoted by the relation constant in the sentenceis true of the objects denoted by the arguments.  Equivalently, viewing arelation as a set of tuples, we say that the relational sentence is true ifand only if the tuple of objects formed from the values of the arguments is amember of the set of tuples denoted by the relation constant.<P>If a relational sentence terminates in a sequence variable, the sentenceis true if and only if the relation contains the tuple consisting of thevalues of the terms that precede the sequence variable together with theobjects in the sequence denoted by the variable.<P><H3>Logical Sentences</H3>A negation is true if and only if the negated sentence is false.<P>A conjunction is true if and only if every conjunct is true.<P>A disjunction is true if and only if at least one of the disjuncts istrue.<P><H3>Forms</H3>If every antecedent in an implication is true, then the implication as a wholeis true if and only if the the consequent is true.  If any of the antecedentsis false, then the implication as a whole is true, regardless of the truthvalue of the consequent.<P>A reverse implication is just an implication with the consequent and antecedentsreversed.<P>Note that the significance of variables in sentences and formsdepends on context.  Variables in an assertion are assumed to beuniversally quantified.  Variables in a query are assumed to beexistentially quantified.  In other words, the meaning of variables isdetermined by the way in which SIF is used.  It cannot be unambiguouslydefined within SIF itself.<HR><ADDRESS><A HREF="mailto:genesereth@cs.stanford.edu">Michael R. Genesereth</A></ADDRESS></BODY></HTML>
