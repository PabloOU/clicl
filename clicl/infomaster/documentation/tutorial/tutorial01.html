It provides integratedaccess to distributed, heterogeneous information sources, thus giving its usersthe illusion of a centralized, homogeneous information system.  Informationconsumers can ask questions, confident that the system will provide informationfrom all relevant information sources.  Authorized information suppliers canadd information updates, confident that the system will distribute thoseupdates appropriately.</P><P>Unlike many Web search engines, Infomaster is concerned exclusively withstructured information.  All of Infomaster's data comes from structured data sources, suchas databases, structured files (using standards like XML), and application programs withdata interfaces (using protocols like LDAP and X.500).</P><P>Second, Infomaster automatically integrates information from multiple information sources,providing a single answer to each question rather than a long list of potentially irrelevantor redundant documents.  In handling updates, Infomaster automatically disseminates the newinformation to appropriate information consumers.</P><P>Third, Infomaster performs these functions in the face of differences in the structureand vocabulary (i.e. schemas) of the sources and providers.  Dealing with heterogeneity ofthis sort requires some additional effort.  However, once the initial effort is expended andwithout any further effort, it is possible for multiple parties to manage information usingtheir own schemas yet automatically share that information with parties using otherschemas.</P><H3>1.2 Structured Data</H3><P>All digital documents possess structure of one form or another.  Meta-information aboutthe "type" of a document dictates how the constituent bits are to be interpreted.  Thisstructure makes it possible for computers to interpret those documents and process them inuseful ways.</P><P>As an example of this, consider an ordinary text file coded in ASCII.  In such a file, thebits are interpreted as characters.  This structure allows computers to display such files,format them, check for misspellings, and so forth.  However, ASCII coding alone does notprovide a way of interpreting the meaning of the text within such files.  It says nothingabout the concepts being discussed or their interrelationships.</P><P>As another example, consider image files.  In this case, the bits are interpreted aspixels, and these pixels can be used to paint images on computer screens.  However, an imagefile by itself does not directly reveal what kinds of objects are in the picture or what isgoing on in the scene.</P><P>The problem is that most documents in use today are only partially structured.  Manydocuments contain information that humans can discern but that is not expressed in thedocument's explicit structure.  Since this information is not explicit, it lies beyond theprocessing power of machines.</P><P>In an attempt to address this problem, information specialists have begun to shift theiremphasis from relatively "unstructured" documents to semantically structured documents(those in which content is expressed explicitly), thus making that content accessible to thecomputer for processing.</P><P>As an example, consider a company database in which personnel and offices and phonenumbers are explicitly represented, along with their relationships to each other.  In thiscase, it is possible for a computer to find all personnel who share the same office or allpersonnel who share the same office but do not share the same phone number or all personnelwho share an office with their managers, and so forth.</P><H3>1.3 Aggregation and Dissemination</H3><P>Without structured information, finding information on the World Wide Web can betime-consuming and error-prone.  The user can search for relevant documents using a subjecthierarchy (as in Yahoo) or by specifying one or more keywords to find in the body of thedocument (as in Google).  In either case, the result is a potentially large list ofsometimes relevant but sometimes irrelevant documents.  The user must then peruse thesedocuments himself in the hope of finding the desired information.</P><P>Furthermore, the interaction is almost invariably "pull" rather than "push".  There islittle support for notification of changes.  The next day, the user must do his searchagain, to see whether anything has changed.</P><P>Finally, in such systems, there is no support for update.  It is not possible for anauthorized user to specify information and have it distributed to appropriate sources.</P><P>One important advantage of structured information is that it enables a solution to theseshortcomings.</P><P>In Infomaster, the user can ask sophisticated questions and get answers instead of longand often incomplete lists of sometimes irrelevant documents.  Information from multiplesources is automatically aggregated into a single document.</P><P>He can post a request to be notified if additional relevant information becomes availableand be sure of receiving only relevant notifications and receiving them only once.</P><P>Infomaster also provides support for updates.  In addition to local updates to individualinformation sources, it supports global updates -- it accepts new information from usersand, provided the users are suitably authorized, ensures that that information isautomatically disseminated to the appropriate information sources for automatic or manualupdate.  Along the way, it is capable of sending notifications to users who have expressedinterest in such changes.</P><H3>1.4 Heterogeneity</H3><P>One of the key features of Infomaster is its ability to deal with heterogeneity among thevarious suppliers and consumers of information.  The problem of heterogeneity can be brokeninto two parts.</P><P>The first problem concerns the format of the data (e.g. XML, TDT, etc.) and/or thecommunication protocol (e.g. LDAP, ODBC, and so forth).  There are a few dozen of these, andit is easy to deal with their differences by hand coding access modules.  Also, we areseeing a move toward standardization on common formats, such as XML, that will diminish thisproblem in the future.</P><P>The second and more serious problem is conceptual heterogeneity, i.e. mismatches in thedata structure and vocabulary used by different clients and sources, i.e. different words,different shapes and sizes of data tables.  In technical terms, each organization is usingits own schema for its data.  While there are only a few dozen different formats, there canbe thousands of different schemas. Integrated product information management requiresmapping between these various schemas and keeping those mappings up-to-date.</P><P>The solution to the mapping problem is the use of relational logic.  Relational logicprovides the conceptual framework for data integration in much the same way that, twenty yearsago, relational algebra provided the conceptual framework for relational databases.</P><P>Like relational algebra, relational logic allows one to write rules to expressrelationships between different schemas.  However, relational algebra is restricted in thatthe underlying database is assumed to be complete.  While this is possible within theconfines of a single corporation, it is a bad assumption when dealing with the Internet. The primary advantage of relational logic is that it allows one to write partial mappings,i.e. constraints expressing partial information rather than complete definitions.</P><P>In Infomaster, all mapping information is encoded in rules.  One can also write businessrules for an individual company e.g. the fact that a company never uses non-corrosive metalsin its products; and one can express industry knowledge as well, e.g. the fact that no-oneputs Teflon on glass.</P><P>Capturing mapping information and business rules and industry knowledge in the form ofrules has multiple benefits.  Rules are modular; each source or client described by rulesthat do not interfere with those for other clients and suppliers.  Rules are mechanicallyanalyzeable to detect inconsistencies or incompleteness.   Most importantly, rules are thebasis for a simple graphical user interface that allows nonprogrammers encode mappinginformation, thus putting that job in the hands domain experts rather than programmers.</P><P>Standing behind Infomaster's use of relational logic is its data transformationtechnology.   Using the rules supplied to the system, Infomaster ensures that queries orupdates in any one known schema are translated accurately and completely to other schemas asappropriate.</P><P>Mapping data directly between end user schemas works well when there are just a fewschemas involved.  However, as the number of schemas grows, this approach becomes unwieldy. With 1000 clients and 1000 sources, there can be 1,000,000 mappings needed.</P><P>The solution to this problem is the use of Infomaster's master schema. In this approach,each end user schema is mapped to the master schema rather than to other end user schemas. This is a much more scalable approach.  With 1000 consumers and 1000 suppliers, thisapproach requires only 2000 mappings.</P><P>Note that using a master schema does not mean that data must actually be written in themaster schema.  The master schema is used only as a reference in writing mapping rules.  Inhandling a transaction, Infomaster uses these rules to synthesize the mapping necessary totransform the suppliers' data directly into the consumer's schema.</P><P>A major challenge in creating an Infomaster system is coming up with a suitable Master Schema. Inventing a schema for any application area is difficult.  Inventing one for the entire WWWis a major challenge.  The solution is to break the problem down into pieces, withresponsibility for different parts falling on different organizations.</P><H3>1.5 Demonstration</H3><P>In this section, we look at a demonstration of Infomaster in action.  The example is asystem built in 1996 at the behest of the National Housewares Manufacturers Association. The goal was to create a virtual catalog for cookware, drawing information from the catalogsof manufacturers (in this case, Corning, Mirro, and Regal) and making the informationavailable in integrated form to retailers (here Costco, Payless, and Sears).</P><P><A HREF=architecture.jpegtarget=infomaster/>Architecture</A>.  The system consists of databases of product informationfor each of the three suppliers and interfaces for each of the three buyers.  Infomasterconnects these various databases and interfaces together, ensuring integrated but customizedaccess to each of the buyers.</P><P><A HREF=001.jpegtarget=infomaster/>Illustration 1</A>.  The opening page provides the user with two types ofsearch.  The high-level categories allow the user to search by category.  The type-in boxallows the user to search to search by keyword.</P><P><A HREF=002.jpegtarget=infomaster/>Illustration 2</A>.  Clicking on a category, such as Product, brings up aparameteric search page for products in that category.  The lee  Clicking on the trianglenext to a category name expands that category to show its subcategories.  This process can berepeated until one finds a sufficiently narrow category.  In this case, we have expanded theProduct category three times to get Domestic cookware.</P><P><A HREF=003.jpegtarget=infomaster/>Illustration 3</A>.  Clicking on a category name brings up a parametricsearch page.  The left pane shows the category hierarchy.  The middle pane shows attributesappropriate to  the selected category, each with appropriate values.  The right pane showsentries that match the search criteria specified.  In this case, no attribute values arespecified; and the system shows all 260 entries in the Cookware category.</P><P><A HREF=004.jpegtarget=infomaster/>Illustration 4</A>.  By selecting values for attributes, the set of possibleanswers is pared down.  As each choice is made, the answers in the right pane areautomatically refreshed.  For example, selecting skillet decreases the possibilities to60.</P><P><A HREF=005.jpegtarget=infomaster/>Illustration 5</A>.  Selecting Teflon for interior decreases the list to 49items.</P><P><A HREF=006.jpegtarget=infomaster/>Illustration 6</A>.  Entering 15 inches for diameter narrows the set ofsolutions to just 5 products.</P><P><A HREF=007.jpegtarget=infomaster/>Illustration 7</A>.  Pressing the Display button brings up a table showingfurther information about the selected products.</P><P><A HREF=008.jpegtarget=infomaster/>Illustration 8</A>.  Clicking any link bring up an "Inspect" pagecontaining of information about the associated concept.  These pages are constructed on thefly from the databases available at the time.  Each page contains information about a singleconcept and contains all information about that concept.</P>For example, clicking on Aluminum shows information about the material aluminum, such asits type (metallic), its possible uses (on the stove top and in the oven but not in themicrowave), and the various products that contain aluminum.</P><P><A HREF=009.jpegtarget=infomaster/>Illustration 9</A>.  Similarly, clicking on the name of a company bringsup information about that company.  For example, here we see that Corning is a US company. There is also a place for suppliers, but none are known.</P><P><A HREF=010.jpegtarget=infomaster/>Illustration 10</A>.  Clicking on Regal brings up analogous information. In this case, we see that Regal is a company in the UK.  (This is not actually true, but thisis just a demo.)</P><P><A HREF=011.jpegtarget=infomaster/>Illustration 11</A>.  Browsing works well when there are just a fewentries, as in this case.  However, when there are thousands of entries, it can be tedious. Parametric search works well when the features of interest are attributes of the type ofitem being sought.  In some cases, the features are indirect, i.e. they are attributes ofthe values of attributes.  Since the search in such cases involves items of multiplecategories, it is often called "cross-category" search.  In order to do cross-categorysearches in Infomaster, the user clicks on the small icon beside the Attribute name.  Thisopens up a sub-search that allows the user to enter features of the value of that attribute.In this case, we have opened up the Manufacturer attribute to allow us to specifyproperties of companies.</P><P><A HREF=012.jpegtarget=infomaster/>Illustration 12</A>.  Here, we have gone further and opened up theNationality attribute of companies to allow us to specify properties on countries.  Clickingon North America here causes the system to display products with the specified features madeby companies incorporated in countries on the North American continent.  Note that there areonly 4 answers.  The Regal product is no longer an answer, as its manufacturer isincorporated in the UK.</P><P><A HREF=013.jpegtarget=infomaster/>Illustration 13</A>.  In order to illustrate Infomaster's support forconceptual heterogeneity, let's compare the source data for a product from one of thesuppliers with the view available to one of the buyers.  Here we have the supplier's view inthe window on the left and the buyer's view in the window on the right.  In the Regalcatalog, the product is listed as a frying pan, whereas, in the Payless catalog, it is askillet.  In the Regal catalog, the interior and exterior are arc-sprayed, whereas in thePayless catalog, the surface is listed as Teflon.  The Regal catalog contains diameter andheight, both in inches, whereas the Payless catalog has capacity in quarts and diameter ininches.  The Regal catalog lists Price in Pounds Sterling, whereas the Payless catalog liststhe price in US dollars.</P><P><A HREF=014.jpegtarget=infomaster/>Illustration 14</A>.  Now, let's change some of the information about thisproduct.  We click on the Change button to convert the Inspect page into a Change page. Then we can make modifications, e.g. switching the product to be a steamer insert, changingthe exterior to be Duracote, changing the price to 100 pounds.</P><P><A HREF=015.jpegtarget=infomaster/>Illustration 15</A>.  We then click on Change to send these changes toInfomaster.  The Inspect page shows that the changes have been accepted.  Of course, thePayless page is the same, since it has not been refreshed.</P><P><A HREF=016.jpegtarget=infomaster/>Illustration 16</A>.  However, clicking the Refresh button causes the newvalues to be displayed.  The product is now listed as an accessory in the Paylessterminology.  Its exterior is still Teflon.  However, the color, computed from the actualexterior material, is listed as black.  Finally, the price has changed proportionally.<P><A HREF=017.jpegtarget=infomaster/>Illustration 17</A>.  Finally, let's take a look at Infomaster's abilityto deal with incomplete information.  One thing we know about Regal is that it makes itsproducts out of just two materials, aluminum and stainless.  Unfortunately, the Regalcatalog does list any material for its products.  Consequently, Infomaster cannot fill inthis field.  On the other hand, things are not so bleak.  Let's consider what happens whenwe search for Regal products.  Here we see  the Payless search page.  Selecting Regal asmanufacturer gives 33 products.</P><P><A HREF=018.jpegtarget=infomaster/>Illustration 18</A>.  Naturally, clicking on Aluminum as material leads tozero hits, as none of the Regal products are known for sure to be made of aluminum.</P><P><A HREF=019.jpegtarget=infomaster/>Illustration 19</A>.  Similarly, clicking on stainless leads to zerohits.</P><P><A HREF=020.jpegtarget=infomaster/>Illustration 20</A>.  However, when we click both aluminum and stainless,all of the products reappear.  Although Infomaster does not know exactly which material isin a product, it knows that in either case it satisfies the user's request.</P>Note that this is a very different answer than one would get from a traditional databasesystem, where a disjunctive query like this one is handled by forming the union of theanswers to queries formed from each disjunct.  In this case, the result would be zero hitsin a traditional database, despite the fact that all Regal products satisfy the user'srequest.</P>Why is it that database systems do not provide the correct answer in this case?  The fact is that most database systems were designed for use in corporate settings, where the dataschema could be designed to ensure that no information is missing.  Sadly, in the Internetsetting, there is no overarching authority requiring that all fields be present.  Yet wewant to get as much information from the available databases as possible.  The logicalreasoning in Infomaster ensures that this criterion is met.</P><H3>Exercises</H3><OL><LI>Connect to the <A HREF="http://persistent.stanford.edu:3000"Target=infomaster>Highfalutin Multimedia Album</A>.
