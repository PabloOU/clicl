Take a look at the subrelations of True in the left panelto see how silly this looks.  There are three occurrences of source in arow.  Bad as that is, I am concerned here not so much at this decision asat the breakdown of procedure.* Actions are out of alphabetic order on the results page of manager.BackwardRules comes first.  Best to keep the basics in order.* What is AnElement?  Is it what in KIF is called Item?* Lots of things have no documentation.* Generally not good to have subclasses of a class that can be instantiateditself.

I would suggest making it an action (kindof like eval) and thereby saving us a menu.* When on search page, clicking an attribute name gives a table of its rows.When on a modify page, it gives an inspect page.  These should be consistent.This disparity is especially distressing because the end users keep gettingmessage like "xxx is unknown" rather than useful table of results.+ In multipane mode, the buttons being off the screen does indeed look VERYunprofessional.* Default for rule save and rule drop should be a ruleserver, e.g. library,not manager or whatever.* When showmenuicons is no, the display in upper left corner is ugly.Everything crammed together.  Typein box should be left justified as whenicons are on.* Some places, notably administrator and manager, we get square irises andsomeplaces, notably standard, we get round irises.  Should be consistent.* ShowMenuIcons allows both yes and no to be checked.
