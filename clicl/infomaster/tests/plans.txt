At any rate,think of it as a plumber rather than as end user system.  Pitch searchcapability as convenience for administrator and can be used if necessary.* Make it easier to see state of the system.  Can we use more graphicalpresentations or are tables good enough?  How about schema presentation viaflippy triangles?  We have this capability now except that each link clickreplaces the page.  Perhaps doing it in place would be nice especially wherevalues viewed as properties rather than related entities.  Could we dosoethiing different if some key is held down?  (I think this covers Stevea.)* Make it easier to move around.  Example.  Click on find agent.  Selectclass there.  Click on specialty tables.  Can we get a table of them? Let's see one of the tables (without going to a different interface). Let's look at the relevant rules (without going to a differentinterface).  Create a fileserver and see the result immediately.  (Ithink this covers Steve b.)* Make sure that clicking anything automatically updates otherwindows/frames.  For example, clicking features should grey outinapplicable classes as well as updating results pane and constrainingchoices of other slots.  How about editing non-normalized tables?  Howabout updates to the displays of others when one admin makes a change? This would require some form of push technology.  Let's do it!  Back toDesignworld.* How about different windows for different agents?  May be methodologicalrather than implementational.  Certainly good for the demo, except limitit to 2 windows.* Computing possible values for a slot from others.  Is this partof the constraint system?* Separate out interface from agent.  Perhaps a new class of objectscalled schema.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;* Showmenuicons should displaystyle noshow.* Agents should have  frame and table attributes.+ Spelled SQLPublisher but SQLserver.  Case of P and s.*** For columns in on an attributerelation I get No entries defined.Ditto for key.  How can this be?  The range is attributerelation.+ Shortdocumentation should have style text rather than textarea* Clicking on an argumentrelation presents no edit button.  Clickingon an argumentrelation as as attributerelation DOES present an edit button.  (NOCHANGE ADMINISTRATOR ARGUMENTRELATION) is wrong.  Dittofor manager.*** Prettynames for argumentrelations do NOT appear in right hand pane butDO appear in the left hand pane.*** When clicking on an argumentrelation, I see no prettyname in eitherinspect or edit mode, despite the fact that, from the left hand pane thereis clearly a prettyname.* Buttons in middle panel still scrolled off the page.+ On single page display, buttons are now all spread out, rightjustified, etc. rather than nicely tabularized as before.  Look at an edit page on a wide window.*** Range of key should be attributerelation.* Clicking on an attribute name in multipane mode brings up a table ofanswers.  Doing the same in single pane mode brings up the inspectpage for that entity.+ Punctuation.  You write "foo, a Bar has no inspectable atributes".  Shouldsay "foo, a bar, has no inspectable attribute".*** Is header there now?* Creating an agent refreshes all panes (good) but left panel is thencollapsed.+ Prettyname Materialize.relation --> Materialize.Relation+ RegisterSelfwithanother and registeranotherwithself are not released,should not appear.* Is modules directory case sensitive?  I called mine Modules and itcouldn't find it.  experiment more...* We never fixed the column style problem for attribute relations.  We can'tspecify column names for attribute relations today, because the arity isn'tknown.x On query page you get a table if you click on an attribute, what are yousupposed to get on inspect page?  It says unknown at the moment.  James saysit's fixed.  Should be  a table -- mrg* FileName attribute on FileServer: clear the combo box selection once theuser makes changes in the edit box.  (John Hammon)* Use of prettynames in manager is very bad.* Interfaceoptions --> interfacefeature+ Most inspectstyle and and displaystyle choices display as glyph.  Thisshould be fixed.* Following error still exists when pushing configure on agents page.Prints in leftmost panel.
