<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<center>Herbrand Logic = First-order syntax + Herbrand Semantics</center>
<ul>
<li>Without functions, entailment is decidable.
<li>With functions, entailment is not semi-decidable and satisfiability is not semi-decidable.
<li>With functions, premises in the <img src="images/forall.gif">* fragment, query in the <img src="images/exists.gif">* fragment, entailment is semi-decidable.
<li>The theory of integer arithmetic, i.e. &lt;N, &lt;, +, *&gt;, is finitely axiomatizable.
<li>Three very successful applications of logic in computer science, Deductive databases, Prolog, and formal verification, all make assumptions that are embodied in Herbrand logic: a domain closure axiom and unique names axioms.
</ul>


<h2>Another Logic?</h2>
<p>Logic has not had the success in computer science that it was once prophesied to have.  Logic programming was supposed to usher in the next generation of computers, but for some reason its popularity has dwindled.  Moreover, students trying to learn the logic foundational to the subfields of CS employing logic often have significant difficulties understanding even the most basic concepts.  A brief look back at the genesis of logic will help to shed some light on why these difficulties exist.

<p>Logic was invented in an attempt to understand the foundations of mathematics.  What does it mean for a theorem to be true?  Does x*y really equal y*x?  Paradoxes are sentences that are neither true nor false, yet they creep into mathematics; is that bad, good, or is it irrelevant?  How can we prove that a mathematical proof is correct?  How do we even make sense of these questions?

<p>First-order logic (FOL) is one answer to the last question.  If some theorem of a mathematical system can be proven from the axioms of that system written in first-order logic, the theorem holds.  Because of this commitment to mathematical truth in general, FOL was defined so that it can be used across a broad spectrum of mathematics.  It is not tailored to the study of integers, real numbers, geometry, topology, or any particular branch of mathematics.  

<p>FOL was certainly not designed to model or manipulate finite machines, the central activities in computer science.  More than that, at times it is ill-suited for the purpose.  Consider a detailed model of a computer which shows how its state, e.g. memory contents and program counter, changes over time.  Because time in a computer is discrete, state can only change on each clock tick.  A finite memory modeled for countably many time steps would require a model of countably infinite size.  But in first-order logic, there is no way to constrain such a model to one of countable size; if a set of first-order sentences has a model of infinite size, it has a model of <i>every</i> infinite size (Lowenheim-Skolem-Tarski).  Thus, in first-order logic, the query, "is the program counter positive at every time step?" is not even expressible.

<p>Nevertheless logic is used throughout computer science, most notably in deductive database theory, logic programming, and formal verification.  Often, the foundations of these fields of study are taught as special cases of first-order logic.  Here we depart from that practice (after having repeatedly taught first-order semantics only to see even the good students misunderstand the very notion of a model), and begin with a logic tailored for computer scientists, whose main interests are modeling and manipulating computers.  It is named (first-order) Herbrand logic, to reflect its first-order syntax and Herbrand semantics.

<p>Part of the motivation for building this website was the frustration brought about by looking for and failing to find general results on this logic.  Herbrand semantics appears repeatedly in the literature of logic programming, but the only results we were able to find in that community are for the fragment of Herbrand logic that  coincides with first-order logic, i.e. <img src="images/forall.gif">* premises and <img src="images/exists.gif">* queries.

<p>Whether Herbrand logic exists in another form or under another name is unclear.  What is clear is its widespread use throughout computer science.  On this site,  we have attempted to explain some of its model theory and proof theory without slanting analysis toward one application or another.  By treating it as a logic in its own right, we hope to provide a simpler framework for conceptualizing and teaching these applications than is currently used, as well as providing a medium for trading ideas across these much studied areas.
