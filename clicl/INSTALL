1) Install CCL.

1a) Download CCL from an appropriate directory.

	svn co http://svn.clozure.com/publicsvn/openmcl/release/1.5/<version>/ccl

where <version> is one of linuxx86, freebsdx86, solarisx86, windows, darwinppc, or linuxppc.

1b) Copy ccl/scripts/ccl or ccl/scripts/ccl64 to somewhere in your PATH.

1c) Set the variable CCL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY to the path to CCL (not ending the path with a /).


2) Compile application

// Put all this into a Makefile ??
cd path/to/code
ccl --eval "(progn (load \"loader\") (save-tlh))"    ; see savess in stringsolver
create shell script with hardcoded path?  Then that shell script can be moved around.

Will see lots of errors.  Ignore them.

3) Run 

To change parameters, edit tlh-init.lisp

// To run, we use a shell script that calls the lisp image output by (2).  Need to figure out which commands to expose via the shell script.
