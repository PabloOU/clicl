1) Install CCL.

1a) Download CCL from an appropriate directory.

	svn co http://svn.clozure.com/publicsvn/openmcl/release/1.5/<version>/ccl

where <version> is one of linuxx86, freebsdx86, solarisx86, windows, darwinppc, or linuxppc.

1b) Copy ccl/scripts/ccl or ccl/scripts/ccl64 to somewhere in your PATH.

1c) Set the variable CCL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY to the path to CCL (not ending the path with a /).

2) Install minisat and SNARK

FILL THIS IN.

3) Compile application

FIGURE OUT HOW TO ALLOW USERS TO CUSTOMIZE GLOBAL VARIABLES. Maybe when saving application, add line somewhere that says (ignore-errors (load "absolutepath/clicl-init")). 

cd /to/path/with/clicl
make

4) Run 

To change parameters, edit clicl-init.

// To run, we use a shell script that calls the lisp image output by (2).  Need to figure out which commands to expose via the shell script.
