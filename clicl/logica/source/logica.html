<HTML><BODY><HR><CENTER><H1>Logica</H1></CENTER><HR><H3>Overview</H3><B>Logica</B> is a simple proof generation system for propositional and relational logic.  It uses the resolution principle applied in breadth-first fashion and subject to strategy specifications supplied by the user. <P><CENTER><H4><A HREF="http://sound.stanford.edu:4000">Click here tostart using the system.</A></H4></CENTER><H3>Language</H3><P>The language used by <B>Logica</B> is a prefix version of the language used in class.  Every expression takes the form of a logical operator or a relation constant followed by its arguments and enclosed in parentheses.<P>The following examples illustrate the relationship between the infix notation used in class and this prefix notation.<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER><TR><TH>Infix</TH><TH>Prefix</TH></TR><TR><TD><TT>r(a,b,c)</TT></TD><TD><TT>(r a b c)</TT></TD></TR><TR><TD><TT>~p</TT></TD><TD><TT>(not p)</TT></TD></TR><TR><TD><TT>p&amp;q</TT></TD><TD><TT>(and p q)</TT></TD></TR><TR><TD><TT>p|q</TT></TD><TD><TT>(or p q)</TT></TD></TR><TR><TD><TT>p=>q</TT></TD><TD><TT>(=> p q)</TT></TD></TR><TR><TD><TT>p<=q</TT></TD><TD><TT>(<= p q)</TT></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P>Case does not matter in this notation.  Upper and lower case versions of a character are treated as the same character.   Variables are denoted by prefixing with the <TT>?</TT> character.  In other words, to enter the variable <TT>X</TT>, type <TT>?x</TT> or <TT>?X</TT>.<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER><TR><TH>Infix</TH><TH>Prefix</TH></TR><TR><TD><TT>p(X,b)=>q(X)</TT></TD><TD><TT>(=> (p ?x b) (q ?x))</TT></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P>We know that it would not have been hard to parse the prefix form, but we just thought of putting this thing up for you recently and wanted to get it in your hands without further delay.<H3>Use</H3><P>Type your premises into the Premise box and your desired conclusion, if any, into the Conclusion box.  If you enter no premises, it will assume you have none.  If you have no conclusion, it will assume <TT>false</TT>.  If the system detects a syntax error in either field, it will treat that field as empty.  So, if    you enter premises or conclusions and do not see any in the resulting proof, it means there is a syntax error.<P>Once you have entered your premises and conclusions, select from among the strategy choices.  The system ALWAYS applies identical step removal, i.e. it will not produce the same conclusion twice.<P>Finally, select how many steps you want to see.  Beware of specifying too high a number.  This will waste system resources and tax your patience.  The proofs you should be considering at this time should be no more than a few dozen steps.<H3>Future Plans</H3>If people think this system has any pedagogical value, we will develop it further in the future.  For example, we will switch to infix format.  We will add additional elimination and restriction strategies and search control capabilities.  In order to facilitate navigation, we will offer hyperlinked proofs as well as linear proofs.  We may add capabilties for using truth tables and Herbrand tables.  We may add unification checkers.  And so forth.  If you have comments, please let us know.<P><HR><ADDRESS>Comments to <A HREF="mailto:genesereth@cs.stanford.edu">Michael R. Genesereth</A>.</ADDRESS></HTML>
