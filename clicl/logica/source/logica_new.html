<H3>Overview</H3>

<B>Logica</B> is a simple proof system for propositional and relational logic.
It includes a truth-table-based satisfiability checker for Propositional Logic;
it includes a unifier for checking unifiability of Relational Logic expressions;
it incudes automatic proof methods based on Resolution and Epilog; and
it includes an editor for manually creating proofs.  Click on the desired link
above to access one of these capabilities.</P>

<H3>Language</H3>

<P>The language used by <B>Logica</B> is a prefix version of the language used
in class.  Every expression takes the form of a logical operator or a relation
constant followed by its arguments and enclosed in parentheses.</P>

<P>The following examples illustrate the relationship between the infix
notation used in class and this prefix notation.  Note: Most of the capabilities
assume a subset of this notation, e.g. Epilog accepts literals and reductions
only.  In fact, only Resolution allows the full syntax.  See descriptions below
for details.

<P>Case does not matter in this notation.  Upper and lower case versions of a
character are treated as the same character.   Variables are denoted by
prefixing with the <TT>?</TT> character.  In other words, to enter the variable
<TT>X</TT>, type <TT>?x</TT> or <TT>?X</TT>.</P>

<H3>Truth Table</H3>

<P>Type any number of Propositional Logic sentences into the expression box.  Press
Check Truth Table to determine joint validity, satisfiability, or unsatisfiability
of the specified sentences.  Press Show Truth Table if you also want to see the truth
table.  Note that the truth tables grow exponentially in the number of propositional
constants.  Specifying too many constants will stress the system.</P>

<H3>Unifier</H3>

<P>Type a single atomic sentence into each of the expression boxes and press Unify to
compute a most general unifier (if any).</P>

<H3>Resolution</H3>

<P>Type your premises into the Premise box and your desired conclusion, if any,
into the Conclusion box.  Remember to use Prefix notation.

If you enter no premises, it will assume you have
none.  If you have no conclusion, it will assume <TT>false</TT>.  If the system
detects a syntax error in either field, it will treat that field as empty.  So,
if    you enter premises or conclusions and do not see any in the resulting
proof, it means there is a syntax error.</P>

<P>Once you have entered your premises and conclusions, select from among the
strategy choices.  The system ALWAYS applies Identical Clause Removal, i.e. it
will not produce the same conclusion twice.</P>

<P>Finally, select a maximum number of steps for the system to take before
quitting.  Beware of specifying too high a number.  This will waste system
resources and tax your patience.</P>

<H3>Epilog</H3>

<P>Type your premises into the Premise box and your desired conclusion, if any,
into the Conclusion box.  Premises should all be literals (e.g. <TT>(p a b)</TT>
and <TT>(q b)</TT>) or reductions (e.g. <TT>(<= (r ?x) (p ?x ?y) (q ?y))</TT>). 
Conclusions should be boolean expressions (e.g. <TT>(and (p a b) (r a))</TT>).

If you enter no premises, it will assume
you have none.  If you have no conclusion, it will assume <TT>false</TT>.  If the
system detects a syntax error in either field, it will treat that field as empty. 
So, if you enter premises or conclusions and do not see any in the resulting proof,
it means there is a syntax error.</P>

<P>Once you have entered your premises and conclusions, select a maximum depth.
Do not specify too high a number.  You may also check the Contrapositives box
if yuo want the system to compute contrapositives before starting inference.</P>

<H3>Editor</H3>

<P>Pretty straightforward after a little experimentation.  Expressions should all
be literals  (e.g. <TT>(p a b)</TT> and <TT>(q b)</TT>) or clauses (e.g.
<TT>(or (r ?x) (not (p ?x ?y)) (not (q ?y)))</TT>).

For premises, type \"Premise\" into one of the justification boxes. For goals,
type \"Goal\" into one of the justification boxes.  For resolutions, enter the line
numbers of the parents into the justification boxes.  Otherwise, the proof checker
will complain.  To get more lines, select the place where you want to insert a new
line and press Add Row at any time.  Press Check Proof after you get to the
last line to check your proof.  Press Clean proof to eliminate redundant lines.</P>

<H3>Future Plans</H3>

<P>This is a quickie implementation, just to see what is needed here. 
Constructive comments welcome.  Snide remarks less welcome (unless
humorous).</P>

If people think this system has any pedagogical value, we will develop it
further in the future.  For example, we will switch to infix format.  We will
add additional elimination and restriction strategies and search control
capabilities.  In order to facilitate navigation, we will offer hyperlinked
proofs as well as linear proofs.  We may add capabilties for using truth tables
and Herbrand tables.  We may add unification checkers.  And so forth.  If you
have comments, please let us know.
