This framework lessens the overhead of authorization management because as users change positions within the company, they need only be assigned different roles, instead of all the permissions that are necessary for performing those roles.  Several good examples in this well-written paper.  What is interesting here is that to perform a given operation, being assigned a role with permission to execute that operation is necessary but not sufficient.  There are also conditions that must hold at the time that operation is to be executed; this gives us both static and dynamic permissions checks to perform.  Moreover, the objects being given permission to execute various operations on are both atomic, e.g. read/write on a file, and entire systems, e.g. one user cannot initiate a purchase order, authorize it, record its arrival, and authorize payment.  These four steps can only occur if at least two people were involved.

The authors may have introduced a very general class of datalog with constraints for the first time here, but that is unclear.  Next the authors give sufficient conditions for classes of constraints that are tractable, i.e. any datalog program using constraints just from the class can be evaluated in time polynomial in the size of the program.  (This is confusing since traditional datalog isn't always polynomial in the size of the program because of recursion, unless I'm mistaken.)
