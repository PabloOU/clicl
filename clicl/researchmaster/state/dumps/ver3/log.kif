have had great industrial success in computer science; however, most automated theorem provers today do not take advantage of database query engines and therefore do not routinely leverage that source of power. Extensional Reasoning is an approach to automated deduction where the system automatically translates an entailment query expressed in classical logic into a query about a database system so that the answers to the two queries are the same. To prove the theorem, the system then evaluates the database query using an off-the-shelf database. 

<br><br>Extensional Reasoning was developed because many problems can be solved efficiently using a database but are naturally expressed using classical logic. In some cases, database query engines solve the database version of the query orders of magnitude faster than traditional theorem proving techniques solve the classical version. Extensional Reasoning helps us build systems that allow a non-expert to write problems down naturally, convert those problems to efficient representations automatically, and solve those problems using industrial-strength systems. 

<br><br>Conceptually, algorithms for performing Extensional Reasoning can be broken into two classes: those for complete theories and those for incomplete theories. A complete theory, one that can answer all the questions in its vocabulary, corresponds naturally to a relational database. Algorithms for this class of theories must recognize the theory is complete and then construct the appropriate database system. In the context of a logic with a finite domain, I present incomplete but low-order polynomial-time algorithms for performing these tasks. An incomplete theory, one for which there is some question in the vocabulary that cannot be answered, does not correspond naturally to a database system, and so the algorithms for performing Extensional Reasoning are more complex. In this case my approach is to construct a new, complete theory that captures the information pertinent to the original problem---a novel form of theory-completion. I present algorithms for performing this type of theory-completion in the same finite logic."))(POS (PAPER.TOPIC HINRICHS2007THESIS EXTENSIONAL))(POS (PERSON.INSTANCE MICHAEL.BACKES))(POS (PERSON.FIRSTNAME MICHAEL.BACKES "Michael"))(POS (PERSON.LASTNAME MICHAEL.BACKES "Backes"))(POS (PERSON.INSTANCE BIRGIT.PFITZMANN))(POS (PERSON.FIRSTNAME BIRGIT.PFITZMANN "Birgit"))(POS (PERSON.LASTNAME BIRGIT.PFITZMANN "Pfitzmann"))(POS (PAPER.INSTANCE PAPER.34090727556))(POS (PAPER.BIBTEX PAPER.34090727556 INPROCEEDINGS))(POS (PAPER.AUTHOR PAPER.34090727556 MICHAEL.BACKES))(POS (PAPER.AUTHOR PAPER.34090727556 BIRGIT.PFITZMANN))(POS (PAPER.AUTHOR PAPER.34090727556 MATTHIAS.SCHUNTER))(POS (PAPER.TITLE PAPER.34090727556 "A Toolkit for Managing Enterprise Privacy Policies"))(POS (PAPER.PUBLICATION PAPER.34090727556 ESORICS))(POS (PAPER.URL PAPER.34090727556 "http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/669343.html"))(POS (PAPER.YEAR PAPER.34090727556 "2003"))(POS (PAPER.DESCRIPTION PAPER.34090727556 "Based on an abstract syntax and semantics of EPAL, the authors discuss several issues surrounding EPAL: refinement, composition, and layering.

Bylander discusses complexity results for propositional STRIPS; he also mentions that a class of first-order STRIPS can be reduced in polynomial time to propositional STRIPS, making these results widely applicable.  PLANSAT (decision problem for determining whether an instance of prop STRIPS planning is satisfiable) is PSPACE-complete.  PLANSAT[2+,2] (PLANSAT where all operators have at least 2 positive preconditions and 2 postconditions) is also PSPACE-complete.  Results are shown for a variety of restrictions, concluding that without severe restrictions, PLANSAT is NP-complete or PSPACE-complete.
These results carry over to PLANMIN (the decision problem of determining whether an instance has a solution of k or fewer operators.  The new results here show a variety of PLANMIN are NP-complete, and a couple, very restricted versions are polynomial.  He also shows results for Propositional Strips with formulas (Extended Propositional STRIPS).  EPLANSAT, EPLANSAT[0,1+] restricted to define Horn clauses are PSPACE-complete.  More results are shown for EPLANSAT and EPLANSATMIN.  See paper for details.

"))(NEG (PAPER.DESCRIPTION HINRICHS2007THESIS "Relational databases have had great industrial success in computer science; however, most automated theorem provers today do not take advantage of database query engines and therefore do not routinely leverage that source of power. Extensional Reasoning is an approach to automated deduction where the system automatically translates an entailment query expressed in classical logic into a query about a database system so that the answers to the two queries are the same. To prove the theorem, the system then evaluates the database query using an off-the-shelf database. 

<br><br>Extensional Reasoning was developed because many problems can be solved efficiently using a database but are naturally expressed using classical logic. In some cases, database query engines solve the database version of the query orders of magnitude faster than traditional theorem proving techniques solve the classical version. Extensional Reasoning helps us build systems that allow a non-expert to write problems down naturally, convert those problems to efficient representations automatically, and solve those problems using industrial-strength systems. 

<br><br>Conceptually, algorithms for performing Extensional Reasoning can be broken into two classes: those for complete theories and those for incomplete theories. A complete theory, one that can answer all the questions in its vocabulary, corresponds naturally to a relational database. Algorithms for this class of theories must recognize the theory is complete and then construct the appropriate database system. In the context of a logic with a finite domain, I present incomplete but low-order polynomial-time algorithms for performing these tasks. An incomplete theory, one for which there is some question in the vocabulary that cannot be answered, does not correspond naturally to a database system, and so the algorithms for performing Extensional Reasoning are more complex. In this case my approach is to construct a new, complete theory that captures the information pertinent to the original problem---a novel form of theory-completion. I present algorithms for performing this type of theory-completion in the same finite logic."))(POS (PAPER.DESCRIPTION HINRICHS2007THESIS "Relational databases have had great industrial success in computer science; however, most automated theorem provers today do not take advantage of database query engines and therefore do not routinely leverage that source of power.

Baumgartner and Tinelli describe a first-order version of the DPLL 
(Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) SAT solver.  In the case of
propositional logic, ME reduces to DPLL.  It differs in the first-order
case because of additional inference rules and skolemization.  The procedure
works by exaustively trying to build a first-order model.  If the search 
fails, the sentences are unsatisfiable.  But if the sentences are satisfiable,
the procedure may run forever trying to construct one.  (Obviously if there
are only infinite models this technique may have issues.)

This paper takes the form of a dialogue between the Author and Quisani.
It gives an introduction to the problem of determining whether a first-
order formula is satisfiable (or valid).  The classic decision problem
is whether this problem is decidable.  Church and Turing showed
it to be undecidable.  Then the question becomes, for which
formulas is this decidable?  Classes are given based on the 
quantifier prefixes that are decidable.  More interestingly, 
a certain set of 4 prefixes are enough to completely solve the
decision problem for prefix classes.

They discuss 3 types of techniques: syntactic, semantic, and hybrid.  Syntactic techniques translate a formula into another formula.

The authors define expresssive power as the set of relations definable
from another set of relations.  They show how to compute which algebraic 
operators are closed for a given set of relations by solving a particular
kind of CSP for the given relations.  Then they show that the set of
relations definable from a given set is equal to the set of relations
that are closed under the same operations as that given set.  If some set
R is closed under the set of operations O and every operation in O is 
what they call essentially unary, the problem is NP-complete.  Moreover,
if O includes an operation that is not essentially unary, it includes
an operation that has arity at most max(3, the size of the domain).
Thus, this paper details sufficient conditions for checking whether
a particular CSP is NP-complete: (1) compute the set of operations
that are closed over the permissible tables in the constraints of the CSP.
(2) If that set includes just essentially-unary operations (which can
be deduced by checking for operations of arity up to max(3, size of domain), 
we are assured the problem is NP-complete.

Bodirsky examines the problem of the homomorphic CSP: given one structure,
is it homomorphic to the target structure?  He for the first time
considers target structures that are countably large; more precisely,
those that are countably large but are omega categorical, i.e. 
all countable models of the first-order theory of that model are isomorphic.
In this work, he produces an algorithm for constructing a tree that
satisfies a given set of constraints, where those constraints require
the existence of nodes that meet certain conditions.  Three possible conditions:
x is an ancestor of y, x and y are equal, and x occurs in a subtree to
the left of the subtree that includes y.  While these constraints force
nodes to exist that satisfy particular relationships, OOCSPs force 
particular nodes to have a particular relationship.
