Alferes shows that Situation Calculus extended with concurrent actions (e.g. buytoothpaste||buyshampoo) is no more expressive than standard Situation Calculus.  Intuitively, give names to every subset of actions since there are only 2^n such subsets of n actions.  Use those names as the actions in situation calculus.  The trouble here is how do we produce the effect axioms of a concurrent action set given the effect axioms of the individual actions?  Some of these axioms simply must be given by the user, e.g. buying toothpaste and shampoo at the same time might result in a free bar of soap, though neither effect axiom for buying toothpaste or shampoo would mention soap.  For those actions whose composition (in Alferes terms) can be determined automatically, the authors offer a solution using nonmonotonic logic: if Holds(p, Result(a, Result(b,s))) and Holds(p, Result(b, Result(a,s))) and there is no definition for Holds(p, Result(a||b),s), then conclude Holds(p, Result(a||b,s)).  Alferes elaborates the rule to include preconditions and subsets of size other than 2 (though some technical details arise in doing the latter).

first-order logic, a synthesis of the object oriented paradigm and
FOL.  Second he applies this logic to theories of action, most notably
situation calculus.  Third he shows how to parallelize automated
theorem proving where a theory has been partitioned into pieces.  Fourth
he gives algorithms for automatically decomposing theories, based on
the syntactic character of the axioms.  Last he describes a logic-based
subsumption architecture for automated robot control, similar in spirit
to Golog.  An appendix on logic, one on reactive control systems, and
30 pages of references round out the thesis.  It should be noted
that while he does augment various resolution procedures to work
in this parallel setting, the rest of the results are independent of
a particular calculus.

The authors leverage previous work on compilation complexity classes to compare
various propositional knowledge formalisms.  They introduce two axes for comparing
such formalisms under translation: theorem-preservation and model-preservation.
That is, given a set of sentences in one formalism, translate those sentences
into another formalism so that (1) the theorems are preserved across the translation
after a translation of their own or (2) the models are preserved across the
translation after a translation of their own.  The translation of premise sets
is assumed to be polynomial in size; the requirement on the translation of
theorems/models is that the representation of the translation process itself
must be polynomial in size.  

The authors then introduce the notion of 
model-C and thm-C classes.  A formalism belongs to the model-C class iff 
model checking in that formalism is in the compilability class C, where the KB is 
the fixed part and the model is the varying part.  A formalism belongs to
the thm-C class iff inference in that formalism is in the compilability class C,
where the KB is the fixed part and the query is the varying part.

Next the authors prove that two formalisms in the same model-C/thm-C class then
there must be a poly-size reduction between the two formalisms that 
preserves models/theorems.  They also show that if two problems are in different
classes there is no polynomial size reduction satisfying models/theorems.

Finally, the propositional formalisms stable model semantics, circumscription, 
generalized closed world, skeptical default logic, credulous default logic, 
WIDTIO belief revision, and skeptical belief revision are analyzed in this 
framework, giving fairly complete coverage of inference/model space complexity.

anytime versions of exact methods, horn approximations (can result in unsound

This paper confronts termination in term-rewriting systems.  
Dershowitz first defines the notion of a non-terminating rewrite system,
i.e. one with an infinite homeomorphic self-embedding derivation.  Then
he defines a simplification ordering as a partial ordering with
the replacement (monotonicity), subterm, and deletion properties.  If there
is a simplification ordering for a term rewriting system such that l > r for
every rewrite rule l -> r then the rewrite system terminates.  Dershowitz
goes on to define a quasi-simplification ordering, which is weaker than
a simplification ordering, making it easier to prove rewrite systems
terminate.  The reason this paper is located in this section is that
the notion of a recursive path ordering is then defined.  RPO and
variants thereof are used in modern theorem provers when ordering
is necessary.  The last section goes through a series of examples
that demonstrate how to prove rewrite systems terminate.

propositional horn knowledge bases, which are represented with 
characteristic models.  Finding
the unique minimal model (which is a characteristic model) can be done
in linear time in the number of KBs.  Finding all-models can be solved
with polynomial delay (a polynomial amount of time between outputting
models).  In a sense, that means the procedure is polynomial, but the 
number of outputs could be exponential.  Finding all characteristic
models of the intersection has no polynomial time algorithm (even if
P = NP).  Answering deductive queries can still be accomplished in
polynomial time by looking at each KB independently.  Finally, abduction
is shown to be intractable, which differs from the result of a single
KB (where it is polynomial).

Fagin generalizes dependencies in the database literature and

S.  1) There is an operator O that maps nonempty families of models
into models such that if sigma is a sentence in S and R_i is a
nonempty family of models, then sigma holds for O(R_i) iff sigma
holds for each R_i.  2) Whenever Sigma is a consistent subset of S
and Sigma* is the set of sentences in S that are logical consequences
of Sigma, there is an Armstrong model--it obeys Sigma* and no other
sentences in S.  3) Whenever Sigma is a subset of S and phi_i is a 
nonempty subset of S then Sigma |= V phi_i iff there is some i for
which Sigma |= phi_i.  For FOL in general, there is no Armstrong relation for 
first-order axiom sets.  Take the empty set of axioms, and assume
there is an Armstrong relation R.  R will either entail or not
entail any non-tautology sigma, which means R is not an Armstrong

that any axiom set Delta in a Horn-related subset of FOL can be

caching is made difficult by the reduction operation, i.e. proofs of

the proven subgoal.  Geddis shows that if a literal has a completion in
one context, it has a completion in every context.  Thus, if a subgoal
cannot be completed, it can be added to a failure cache.  A completion is
not the same as a proof, however, and there are no results for success
caching.  If a depth-limited search-strategy is used, incompleteness can
result; Geddis found no solution for this problem.  Also discussed is an
extension to David Smith's work: postponement caching.  It basically avoids
infinite recursions if possible by 'enslaving' a subgoal to an ancestor

ConGolog extends Golog (both implementations being in Prolog) to include concurrent actions (conceptualized as interleaving actions of different processes that can block, in the OS sense).  The constructs introduced here include synchronized conditionals (test-and-set), synchronized loops, concurrent execution, concurrency with different priorities (the lower priority process can only execute if the higher priority one is blocked or finished), concurrent iteration, and interrupts.  Nondeterminstic iteration can be useful when an unspecified number of programs need to be run concurrently, e.g. an FTP server.  Some more work is required to handle procedures.  The semantics given in the original Golog paper were evaluation semantics.  Here the authors switch to transition semantics and require all the macros of Golog to become embedded in the language.
Exogenous events are handled by allowing the user to specify which primitive actions may occurs outside the control of the program.  A predefined program for choosing a possible exogenous action, checking its preconditions, and executing it if possible is run concurrently with the user-defined program. To handle truly overlapping actions such as filling-bath-tub and singing-do-re-mi, the authors suggest thinking of filling-bath-tub as not an action, but rather as a state, which requires the start-filling action to enter the state and the stop-filling action to exit the state.  This way, interleaving filling-bath-tub and singing-do-re-mi can happen at the same time.

Giunchiglia and Walsh describe a theory of abstraction in very general terms,
which is intended to be independent of proof system.  Most generally,
an abstraction is a mapping between a pair of formal systems, where a
formal system consists of a language and a subset of that language defining
the axioms.  Axiomatic formal systems include an extra element: the
proof system.  Abstractions are categorized by whether they increase, decrease, or
leave constant the set of consequences of the theory: TI, TD, TC.  The authors
claim the TI abstractions is the true meaning of abstraction.  TD abstractions
can be used to prove entailment, i.e. if TD(Delta) |= phi then Delta |= phi.
TI abstractions can be used to prove negative entailment, i.e. if
TI(Delta) |/= phi then Delta |/= phi.  Refutation systems are concerned
not with provability but with inconsistency.  Abstractions in this setting
are characterized as NTI, NTD, and NTC.  If the formal system includes
negation and the abstraction f is negation preserving, i.e. f(-phi) = -f(phi)
then NT* and T* are equivalent.  Further classifications are made of abstractions,
depending on how independently an abstraction translates axioms, inference rules, etc.
A large section explaining how various peoples' work fits into this framework follows.
Then sections follow on inconsistent abstract spaces, operations performed
on abstractions, ordering abstractions, hierarchies of abstraction spaces, and building
abstractions.

it to be undecidable.  Then the question becomes, for which

Haas describes an approach for reasoning about belief, both an agent's own
beliefs and another agent's belief's.  First, we represent an agent's belief's
with Believes(agent, sentence), where sentence names a sentence of FOL.  Haas
names sentences of FOL by quoting each component, i.e. p(a) is named 'p('a)
(it looks cleaner in prefix notation).  He also gives names for intervals of
time so he can state how long it will take for an agent to believe a certain
sentence; afterall inference is not instantaneous.   In order to give an agent
the ability to determine what another agent will infer, Haas borrows
Konolige's suggestion of implanting an agent's inference rules into the
Believes statements.  Then, Haas introduces The Reflection Schema to do
inference.  Specifically,
Ax1,..,xn. (ClosedTerm x1)^...^(ClosedTerm xn) => IsProof(s)
s is a proof quoted appropriately.  He shows this schema sound and complete.
Haas goes on to define 'Knowing What' in terms of the context of what was asked.
'Knowing How' means a robot has a program to execute.  Finally, Haas connnects
belief and truth using the truth predicate: 'true(quote p) 'iff 'p.  The
Liar's paradox shows up here, but Haas avoids it by proving if p is ground,
true produces no contradictions.

CGR begins with a graph of clauses with
edges between complementary literals.  Activating an edge
means performing a step of resolution, producing a new 
clause graph.  Then they show that ordered resolution
is a special case of cg-resolution (for prop logic) and then
that ordered cg-resolution will always terminate.  Ordered
cg-resolution enforces a total ordering on literals so
that resolution is applied only to the maximally ordered
literal in a clause.  It is a little unclear to what extent
the results are new, but apparently
the proofs are simpler than those given in the past.  At the end,

Halevy's survey splits the work that answers queries using views into two
cateogires: using materialized views to speed up query answering and
data integration.  In the former setting, materialized views have the potential
to speed up query answering because some portion of the query may have already
been computed and stored in the db as a materialized view.  The goal here is
to produce an efficient execution plan that uses base tables and materialized views.
In the latter setting, data integration techniques provide a schema, sometimes
called the mediated schema, for a user to query a large number of separate
databases.  To define how each individual schema relates to the mediated schema,
the tables in the individual schemas are expressed as views of the mediated schema.
Here the work focuses on rewriting the query in terms of the views of the mediated
schema, i.e. in terms of the database schema that actually exist.  This case is
particularly interesting because it requires the views to be treated as
incomplete, e.g. both the database of american cars and the database of foreign
cars contribute to the car table.

In this paper, we describe an approach for automatically generating configurations for complex applications. Automated generation of system configurations is required to allow large-scale deployment of custom applications within utility computing environments. Our approach models the configuration management problem as an Object-Oriented Constraint Satisfaction Problem (OOCSP) that can be solved efficiently using a resolution-based theorem-prover.

Herbrand logic has the same syntax as first-order logic but has Herbrand semantics. That is, the only models that exist in Herbrand logic are the Herbrand models. This logic is easier to learn than first-order logic and is often better suited for modeling and manipulating today's computer systems, the central concerns of computer science. In Herbrand logic, arithmetic using the natural numbers if finitely axiomatizable; however, neither entailment nor satisfiability are semi-decidable. Nevertheless, four of the most industrially successful applications of logic in computer science have been built within fragments of Herbrand logic: deductive databases, logic programming, constraint satisfaction, and formal verification. In this paper, we define Herbrand logic formally, prove several of its properties, discuss Goedel's incompleteness result with respect to Herbrand logic, and demonstrate how each of the four applications mentioned above can be formalized within Herbrand logic.

if O includes an operation that is not essentially unary, it includes
an operation that has arity at most max(3, the size of the domain).
Thus, this paper details sufficient conditions for checking whether
a particular CSP is NP-complete: (1) compute the set of operations
that are closed over the permissible tables in the constraints of the CSP.

This paper explains how model-based reasoning can be used to model reasoning
with context.  Suppose the KB is represented by a set of models M.  As the agent's
context changes, new sentences appear that define that context.  Entailment in
the context then means that the sentence holds in the subset of models M that
satisfy those new sentences.  By representing the theory as a set of models,
as context changes, that set can be reduced online.  In this paper, context
change is represented using default logic.  Algorithms are given for both
skeptical and credulous default reasoning where the knowledge base is represented
as a set of models.  Conditions are given under which these algorithms work
correctly.  Finally, the learning to reason paradigm is brought up as a third
argument for representing a KB as the set of models that satisfy it.  All three,
context, defaults, and learning to reason, sometimes produce computational
benefits because models are used to represent knowledge.

Reasoning with Examples means reasoning with enough models to correctly
determine entailment.  This technique shows up both in the database
literature under the name 'Armstrong Relations' and in the automated
reasoning literature under the name 'Characteristic Models'.  While
the latter refers to a set of examples, the former refers to a single
example.  The number of models needed in Characteristic Models for
propositional logic is bounded by |B|*|DNF(kb)|, where B is the 
basis for the knowledge base kb.  The bulk of this paper shows how the 
two concepts are closely intertwined; it goes on to show that finding

The authors go through some of the work on partial evaluation in the case
of pure logic programming, which is called partial deduction.  (It differs
from partial evaluation in LP because axioms can be partially partially 
evaluated in the case of non-ground static arguments.)  Partial deduction
means constructing a partial SLDNF tree for a query, and using the fringe
to imply the goal as the output.  Interestingly, with negation, most work 
focuses on preserving operational semantics, as the well-founded semantics
are preserved for all groundings of the goal(s).  This paper focuses on
control issues surrounding the constructing of these SLDNF trees: (1)
given a goal atom A, how do we construct a tree, the local control
problem, and (2) what is the set of all goal atoms, the global control. 
The second problem only occurs because of the desire to preserve
procedural semantics.  The process of unfolding, i.e. constructing
the tree, is difficult because applying too many resolutions can 
result in local code explosion, work duplication, and non
termination.  If the unfold function is guaranteed to produce a tree 
with at most one non-failing
branch, it is said to be determinate; determine unfolding will not
produce code explosion or work duplication.  It is undecidable to determine
whether a tree with at most one non-failing branch can be constructed.
Approximations are usually used.   To deal with termination, binding-time
analysis is used (sometimes computed using abstract interpretation), which
creates annotations that have decided whether to unfold or not.  Instead of
handling termination offline, another approach handles it online--during
specialisation.  Well-founded and well-quasi orders are popular here.  
There is also a discussion of global control issues.  Interestingly,
tabling with partial deduction can turn a terminating program into
a nonterminating program.  Long reference list.

Intro: Classical planning doesn't deal with the problem of sensing or looping, e.g. it cannot produce plans that will successfully achieve the Airport or the Omlette examples.  Sensing is necessary iff there are properties of the world that cannot be deduced at plan time but that are required for achieving the goal.

<br><br>Classical Planning: Use sit calc to formally define the classical planning problem.  It is unclear to me whether the sit calc he is using would somehow allow there to be partial order plans, e.g. return something like (do (parallel a b c) (do (parallel e f) (do h s0))).  For now let's say it can't and sitcalc plans must be total orders.  We might argue that because his definition is tied to sitcalc, which produces only totally ordered plans, his 'definition' of the classical planning problem is wrong.  But it doesn't really matter for the rest of what he is going to say.

Incorporating sensing actions: gives an overview of another one of his papers which introduces sensing actions into sitcalc, and reviews some related work.

<br><br>Robot programs: introduces a language for describing plans that is more expressive than the standard sitcalc (do a (do b (do .... s0)))) and partial order languages.  Includes loops and branches.  He defines the semantics of the language in situation calculus, relying on a new second order construct for defining the semantics of a loop.  Finally, he states the first theorem, which amounts to a set of rewrite rules for each of the new constructs in the robot language, where the rewrite rules allow one to construct an interpreter for the language.  That is, the obvious interpreter for the language does the right thing, and the theorem proves that.

The revised planning task: formalize, using the machinery built up above, the planning problem as it includes loops, branches, and sensing.  Remember this is all sitcalc in first-order logic + a couple second-order constructs.  The rest of the section works through the Airport example.

<br><br>Note: Importantly, all the examples thusfar, as well as the definition of the planning task requires a _deductive_ solution.  That is, the airport example includes the axiom AtGate(a) | AtGate(b).  At plan-time we can prove that the plan (seq goto-airport (if check-gate(a) then goto-gate-a else goto-gate-b)) will work.  This is unlike our room reservation example since there may be no room to reserve, but we won't know that until plan execution time.  At plan-time, there is no plan we can prove will work.

<br><br>Are robot programs enough?: They claim the original plan language is not sufficient for expressing plans for every solvable planning problem.  The reason is that there is no memory available for the program to use.  Asking for a plan that returns the number of eggs it is given at runtime cannot be achieved without (infinite) memory.  Levesque adds 5 actions (left, right, mark, erase, read_mark) that can be used to expand the plans expressible by his robot language to include (he claims) everything that is computable.  That is, his planning language with these additional actions would force a planner to construct a Turing Machine that achieves the given goal.  Of course, that problem is undecidable.  

<br><br>A two sentence summary.  Levesque introduces a plan description language that includes branching and loops (with an extension that he claims makes the language Turing complete), for the simple reason that solving some real world planning problems requires sensing and looping.  He formalizes the planning problem as one of deduction, which has the benefit that deductive solutions will always be right but has the drawback that it eliminates plans that we might expect a machine to produce, e.g. room reservation.

In the context of Logic programming, the authors consider two problems:
(1) detecting whether a relation will ever return more than one answer
through all control paths, i.e. whether the relation is determinate,
 and (2) determining whether more than one
rule with for a relation will ever be satisfied for
the same query, i.e. whether the rules defining that relation
are mutually exclusive.  Addressing these questions relies on type
information, i.e. all the possible queries asked for a relation, and
mode information, i.e. whether a variable is used for validation or
for generation.  For r to be determinate, it is sufficient
that every relation that is a subgoal of r be mutually exclusive.
Thus an approximation of (1) can be accomplished by computing (2).  The test
for mutual exclusion offered here will return true only when all the 
rules for a relation contain procedural attachments that can be shown
to be mutually exclusive for all the types of the relation.  Experimental
results are shown for the case where the procedural attachments are
equality/distinction/inequality.

Streett automaton and behavior automaton.  The first-order
theorem proving is automated with non-clausal resolution

theorem proving is handled with a Gentzen-style prover:
both first-order and temporal first-order.  Propositional
temporal formulas can be automatically verified.

introduce a new variable, replace the term with that variable, and include
the sentence where that variable is set to the term in the appropriate

is unsatisfiable.  Otherwise, compute all the strongest equality theorems

Pinto tackles the problem of expressing occurrences in situation calculus.  Occurrences are sequences of events that really do happen in every hypothetical branch of the situation tree.  In deductive plan synthesis via the Green method, we want all plans returned to include all the occurrences given.  Pinto names two specific types of occurrences: narratives (a partial specification of a sequence of events known to happen) and triggers (as in the database sense).  His formulation assigns time values to situations, a second order induction axiom, along with an extension to the sitcalc ontology to define 'nonpreventable occurrences', 'conditional occurrences', and 'simple occurrences'.  He defines 'legal(s)' in terms of these 3 occurrence types to mean that a situation s includes all the mentioned occurrences and is a valid sitcalc situation.  Pinto goes on to define when one situation is preferred to another: s preferred-to s' iff s' has the same actions as s with extra actions appended to the end.  For planning, Pinto shows that instead of finding an s s.t. goal(s) is true, we can find an s s.t. goal(s) ^ legal(s) is true.

Pirri and Reiter formalize the theory of situation calculus and define basic
action theories as D = Sigma U D_ss U D_ap U D_una U D_s0.  Sigma are the
foundational axioms (induction, situation ordering, equality, unique names
for situations); D_ss are
successor state axioms; D_ap are action precondition axioms; D_una are unique
name axioms for actions; D_s0 are initial state axioms.  This definition
appears throughout later work on the situation calculus.  Well written.
They also define Regression (in a clearer way than reiter91--the
Frame problem...), which means rewriting a regressable formula so that the only
situations referenced are S0.  Entailment of a regressed formula requires
only knowledge
of D_s0 and D_una.  Pirri and Reiter also give conditions when induction is

unnecessary.  They go on to show that Sigma is unnecessary for GOLOG programs.

In the context of Horn prolog with built-ins, the authors address the
problem of efficiently unfolding of recursive relations.  That is,
one implementation of partial evaluation/partial deduction is to produce
a partial SLD tree and using the fringe as the body of a rule for proving
the goal.  The problem with this approach is that the recursive relations 
produce infinite SLD trees, unless the recursion is cut off.  To determine
when the recursion should be cut off, a common practice is to apply a
recursive rule only when the subgoal is smaller, according to some
ordering, e.g. well-founded, well-quasi, than all its ancestors.  To
implement that, all the ancestors of each goal have in the past 
been stored, which is expensive both in time to check and in space
to store.  This paper tackles this problem by expanding the tree in a 
variant of depth-first search so that only the current call stack need
be stored.  They also consider the case of built-in predicates.

Reiter explores techniques for doing first-order reasoning with 
a Domain Closure Axiom
(x=a1 | x=a2 | ... | x=an).  He focuses on axiom sets for which there
are a finite number of object constants, no function constants, and when
written in prenex form include no existential quantifiers.
To do so he (1) shows that existential queries will never require
the DCA, for algorithms exploiting Herbrand's theorem, and 
(2) how to build on this fact 
to answer any kind of query by peeling away quantifiers to build an 
existential query.  The second step uses a generalization of the 
relational database division operator for universal quantifiers and a 
generalization of the projection operator for existential quantifiers. 
Next it is shown that Horn databases and positive existential queries never 
require computing disjunctive answers. 
Then conditions are given for the removal of all but the x=x equality axiom: 
E-saturation, i.e.
unique names over all the constants.  Lastly it is
shown that extending DCA to include infinitely many constants can result in
an infinite disjunction as an answer to a query.  Very thorough, as always.

Reiter formalizes Database theory from a logical perspective.  Databases in this view are first-order models, and integrity constraints are sentences that such a model satisfies.  A relational theory (the set of sentences entailed by a relational database) can be defined as the set of ground atoms in the DB, a completion axiom for each table ensuring that those ground atoms not in the table are false, unique-names axioms, a domain closure axiom, and equality/substitution axioms.   Proof is provided.  Next Reiter goes on to generalize this definition to handle positive disjunction, which requires altering the completion axioms.

axioms of the form
Poss(a,s)=>[R(do(a,s)) =def= r_pos(a,s) V R(s) ^ ~r_neg(a,s)].  Poss(a,s) is
the action precondition axiom; R(do(a,s)) is the fluent, r_pos(a,s) is the
positive effect axiom for R; r_neg(a,s) is the negative effect axiom for R.
This works when also given a single definition for Poss(A,s) for each action A,
unique naming axioms for actions and states.  This technique requires F+A
axioms instead of 2*A*F axioms to describe frame and effect axioms for a
domain, where F is the number of fluents and A the number of actions.
Reiter also discusses a regression operator, which does deductive plan synthesis by taking a normal situation calculus axiomitization (using successor state axioms) and rewrites it so that every fluent only mentions S0.

The authors describe a technique for resolution that allows resolution
to break a clause apart when variables are not shared between pieces.
Suppose the clause C can be partitioned into 2 parts D and E, where each
part shares no variables with any other part.  Splitting replaces
C with the clauses D | p and E | -p.  This only makes sense when there
is an ordering imposed on the literals so that p and -p are not immediately
resolved together undoing the work of splitting.  The authors investigate
two orders: blocking and parallel.  In blocking, the -p literals 
are ranked highest; the non p literals are ranked next with negative
bigger than positive; the p atoms are ranked lowest.  In parallel,
the p literals (positive or negative) are ranked last.  Also, 
these p literals are considered names.  If there is another clause 
C' with partition D and F, then C' is split into F | -p.  Some
experimental results from TPTP show that splitting is a bad idea
with equality but that Parallel ordering with Naming is a good idea
without equaity.

To that end, Sacerdoti first plans through an abstract plan space and then refines a solution in that space to ensure the details support the abstraction.  To implement this idea, Sacerdoti extends STRIPS by assigning 'criticality' measures to each precondition of an action.  These measures define a hierarchy of abstraction spaces.  The planner finds a solution at the highest level of abstraction, and proceeds recursively to the next highest level.

Sandford describes a new refinement of semantic resolution, hereditary 
lock resolution, and a new approach for representing models as required 
in semantic resolution.  The pertinent part of the work is the model 
representation.  Semantic resolution puts clauses into two bins throughout 
the resolution process.  Part of the input to the procedure is a model, 
any model, and those clauses that are satisfied by the model are put into 
bin 1 while clauses not satisfied by the model are put into bin 2.  
This partitioning of clauses shrinks the search space since every resolution 
must use at least one clause from the set of unsatisfied clauses.  
Sandford describes a method for using a set of sentences to define that 
model (in possibly a totally different language) and using a satisfaction 
test to determine whether a clause belongs in bin 1 or 2.   Of course, 
the computational and complexity properties could be horrible, but so

Shostak describes what is now commonly known as Shostak's decision procedure.
The decision procedure works on algebraically solvable and canonizable

the terms in the language representing each one by their canonical forms.  
The canonization takes into account both interpreted and unintepreted
functions.  Unlike Nelson Oppen, Shostak shows how to merge the decision
procedures for two theories by taking a solver and canonizer for each and
building a single solver and canonizer pair for the union of the theories.

requires all the background theory signatures to include all the

the common signature among the theories.  One can thus alter the tableau
procedure by allowing a new type of derivation: hand off a subset of the
literals on a particular branch which are of the appropriate signature

de Waal and Gallagher show how to employ the results of (1) approximation
of logic programs and (2) partial evaluation to produce strategies
for pruning the search space of theorem proving procedures.  They model
a theorem proving algorithm as a logic program, add in the theory and query
in question, and run approximation techniques after partially evaluating
the constructed logic program.  Regular unary clauses (r(f(x1,...,xn) <= 
t1(x1) ^ ... ^ tn(xn))are used to
do the approximations, but the technique can be applied to different
approximations as well.  The authors demonstrate this technique on
a model-elimination procedure and a Naive nH-Prolog proof system.

Weyhrauch describes the FOL system.  FOL allows rules to be written that
produce semantic attachments, i.e. attaching Lisp addition to the function
symbol '+'.  It also allows rules that rewrite expressions.  FOL includes
an evaluator for first order logic that combines the rewrite rules with
the semantic attachments to do proofs.  FOL is a system that operates on
'LS pairs': a set of logical sentences, a set of attachments, and a set
of facts.  Because this is done uniformly, FOL allows multiple LS pairs
to be defined at the same time.  A special LS pair, Meta, is a theory
of LS pairs; reflection is achieved in FOL by allowing Meta to
operate on another LS pair.   Metametalevel reasoning
can be accomplished in the same way.  Self-reflection is another special
case of this mechanism--give Meta the LS pair Meta to operate on.

on a state-based persistence formalism (Zhang's work), and assumes
a domain-closure axiom.  It considers actions with disjunctive effects
and preconditions, but does not provide complete results for those
cases.  It relies on the use of induction to prove a candidate
state constraint is actually a state constraint, but the generation
of these candidates is done algorithmically.
