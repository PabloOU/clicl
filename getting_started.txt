Probably the first thing is getting you set up with the code we have.

It's in a git repository.  So if you're not familiar, look into that a
bit.  We'll likely only need the basics: pushing, pulling, committing.
http://git-scm.com/

It's hosted on google code.  
Once you have an account, send me your gmail address, and I'll give
you rights to commit.

Download instructions:
http://code.google.com/p/clicl/source/checkout

Once you download, there is a file INSTALL with instructions.  Only
been tested with Mac/Unix.  You'll only need CCL (not Snark or
minisat).  Give the install a try and let me know if you have
problems.

The code is all Common Lisp.  The new language we're designing also
looks like Lisp (mainly so we don't need to write a parser).  If you
haven't used Lisp/Scheme before, it would be good to go through a
tutorial.  I don't know of any good ones off-hand, so Google is your
friend here.  I can, however, recommend a free online book I've used
as a reference several times:

The other thing to do is to look at the app I've started porting over to our
language and get familiar with it.

To see what we've ported so far, run clicl and start a tcp server on port 5000 ...

hinrichs:clicl thinrich$ ./bin/clicl
Welcome to Clozure Common Lisp Version 1.8-r15286M  (DarwinX8664)!
? (starttcp 5000)
#<PROCESS tcp-handlers(2) [Reset] #x302000BF671D>

Then fix a bug where we're hardcoding a pathname by entering the following..

? (setq *fs-path* "FULLPATH-TO-CLICL/researchmaster/")

So for me, this is ....

? (setq *fs-path* "/Users/thinrich/Research/code/clicl/researchmaster/")

Then go to your browser and try the following urls.

http://localhost:5000/scwa?servlet=new-registration
http://localhost:5000/scwa?servlet=show-profile
http://localhost:5000/scwa?servlet=show-login

The links on the pages definitely don't work.  I don't remember what
else works and what doesn't.  But poke around a little.  You should be
able to register as a new user, login, and edit your profile (via
show-profile).  To logout, you need to manually delete the cookie that gets set when you login.
